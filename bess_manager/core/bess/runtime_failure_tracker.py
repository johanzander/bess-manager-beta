"""Runtime API failure tracking for BESS Manager.

This module provides in-memory tracking of API operation failures that occur
after retry exhaustion. Failures are displayed to users in the UI and can be
dismissed individually or in bulk.

Design:
- In-memory only (cleared on restart)
- Max 100 failures (FIFO eviction of oldest dismissed)
- Thread-safe for concurrent access
