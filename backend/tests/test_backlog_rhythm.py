Every rule in `.claude/skills/backlog` had been written down and none had ever

noticing now lives in this script as pure comparisons over the digest, so it
can run on a timer for the cost of a process. These tests pin the comparisons.

`RHYTHM_DIGEST_FILE` / `RHYTHM_PRS_FILE` are the script's test seams (the same
