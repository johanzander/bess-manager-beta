    the first-draft jq used `select(...) // null` to pick "the" PR for an

    *no* output — with one match it returns that match, but with two or more
    matches `select(...)` is a stream and the whole expression becomes a
    stream of PR objects rather than a single scalar. Downstream that stream
    gets cross-multiplied into the `items[]` comprehension, silently emitting
    one duplicate item row per extra match instead of picking a single PR
    deterministically. This issue has two open PRs that both match it (one by
    `Fixes #N` in the body, one by headRefName pattern), which triggers the
