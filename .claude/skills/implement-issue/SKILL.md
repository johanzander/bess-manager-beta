description: Use when asked to implement, fix, or resolve a bess-manager GitHub issue end-to-end from the command line, especially when local verification (not just CI) is wanted before the PR opens.

# Implement Issue

## Overview

Drive a bess-manager GitHub issue from diagnosis to a locally-verified draft
PR against `main`. This is the CLI counterpart to the `@claude-bot analyze` +
`@claude-bot fix` pipeline (`docs/agents/workflow.md`) — same diagnose-then-fix
shape, but with the one thing the bot pipeline structurally cannot do: run the
app locally and observe the fix working before the PR opens. That local
verification step is the entire reason to run this from the command line
instead of the bot, so it is never optional.

This skill orchestrates other skills — it does not re-implement them:
`superpowers:using-git-worktrees`, `superpowers:test-driven-development`,
`superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`, `code-review`, `verify`, and
the `bess-analyst` sub-agent.

## When to Use

- User gives you a bess-manager issue number/URL and asks you to implement,
  fix, or resolve it locally.
- Not for the `feature-lifecycle` multi-release integration flow (new
  inverter/price-provider platforms) — that skill owns experimental→stable
  graduation across multiple beta cycles. Use `implement-issue` for
  single-PR bug fixes and small enhancements.

## CI mode (GitHub Actions)

`issue-fix.yml` runs this skill on `claude-code-action` instead of duplicating
its instructions. The numbered Process below applies verbatim **except** where
an interactive-session mechanism has a pipeline equivalent, per this table.
User-level plugins (`superpowers:*`, `code-review`) are not installed on CI
runners — only repo-level `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` exist there.

| Step | CI mode |
|---|---|
| 2. Diagnose | Stage 2 comment absent → STOP. Post "No deep analysis found. Run `@claude-bot analyze` first" and exit — never self-diagnose in CI; the analyze/fix split *is* the human gate. |
| 3. Confirm gate | The owner's `@claude-bot fix` comment is the go-ahead. Still perform the workaround check and scope assessment — put them in a `## Scope assessment` section of the PR body instead of chat. Escalation path (can't confidently pass the workaround check) still applies: dispatch a fresh general-purpose `Agent` to critique the design before implementing. |
| 4. Worktree | Skip — the CI checkout is already isolated. Create the branch directly (naming per Step 1). |
| 5. TDD | The substance applies verbatim (RED test first, required test shape); there is just no `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill to invoke — follow this section's own rules. |
| 6. Quality gate + code review | Run inline, no background agent (CI is one throwaway session — the cost-discipline reason to background doesn't exist). The `code-review` plugin is unavailable; the Stage-4 `@claude-bot` PR review covers it. Checks 1–3 (fast suite, slow suite, required-test-shape) still apply. |
| 7. Confirm gate 2 | Replaced by the draft PR itself — the owner reviews the draft before anything merges. |
| 8. Local run & observe | Structurally unavailable in CI — this is the documented reason the local flow exists. Skip, and say so in the PR body's test plan so the reviewer knows verification is still owed. |
| 9. Commit + draft PR | Applies verbatim, including the `CHANGELOG.md` `## [Unreleased]` entry and the documentation check. Add the `## Scope assessment` section (Step 3 above). The workflow file owns CI-only mechanics: issue comment with the PR link, `has-fix-pr` label. |
| 10. Hard constraints | Apply verbatim. |

## Process

### 1. Fetch & scope

```bash
gh issue view <n> --json title,body,labels,comments
```

Read chronologically for the CURRENT problem — issues evolve, don't fix a
stale complaint. Branch prefix from label: `bug` → `fix/`, `enhancement` →
`feat/`. Branch name: `<prefix>/issue-<n>-<slug>`.

### 2. Diagnose (conditional)

Check the issue comments for an existing Stage 2 diagnosis: a bot comment
with `## Root cause` / `## Evidence` / `## Proposed fix` sections (label
`analyzed`). This is the common case — issues are usually run through
`@claude-bot analyze` first.

- **Comment present:** use it as the diagnosis. Independently verify by
  reading the cited `file:line` locations against current code — quote real
  code, don't just trust the summary. Do NOT re-run `bess-analyst` from
  scratch.
- **Comment absent:** dispatch `bess-analyst` as a sub-agent (`Agent` tool,
  `subagent_type: bess-analyst`) for a full independent diagnosis — pass it
  the issue title, body, and comment history, and the task: "diagnose
  independently; the reporter's explanation is a hypothesis, not a
  conclusion."

### 3. Confirm gate

Present the root cause, proposed fix, AND its scope assessment per
`docs/agents/rules.md`'s Debugging Protocol step 8. That includes the
**workaround check**: state explicitly that the diff adds nothing — no
parameter, flag, default-fallback, second construction site, extra trigger
or branch — whose only job is to route around an ordering/timing/dependency
problem instead of fixing it. If you can't state that confidently, dispatch
a fresh `Plan`/general-purpose agent to critique the design before
presenting anything. Then the scope category: does the fix stay within
the target method's existing contract (local), does it need a different/new
owner (structural), or does it have multiple plausible owners worth a second
opinion? State which, explicitly — don't let the user infer it from the diff
description. A structural assessment with no stated reason for the chosen
owner is not ready to present. Wait for explicit go-ahead before touching
code. One message — cheap insurance against building an entire
implementation on a wrong diagnosis *or* a wrong placement.

### 4. Worktree + branch

`git fetch origin main` first — `using-git-worktrees`' git fallback branches
from the current local `HEAD`, not `origin/main`, so a stale local checkout
silently cuts the branch behind main (missed release cuts, changelog
rewrites, other merged fixes), surfacing later as an avoidable merge
conflict. Then invoke `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`, basing the new
branch on `origin/main`.

### 5. TDD implementation

Invoke `superpowers:test-driven-development`. Write a test that reproduces
the bug (from the diagnosis's evidence — the specific period/scenario/input)
and watch it fail, then write the minimal fix. No refactors outside the bug
— match `docs/agents/patterns.md`.

**Required test shape — checked against the diff, not optional:**

If the fix touches the DP (`dp_battery_algorithm.py`), intent classification
(`decision_intelligence.py`), or control/rate mapping (`inverter_controller.py`
/ `battery_system_manager.py`), the PRIMARY RED test — not an extra test
alongside it, the one that proves the bug — is a plan-faithfulness scenario,
not a unit test calling the changed function with hand-built arguments. Write
it as:

```python
from core.bess.tests.helpers import run_scenario_realized
# scenario is a full DP-optimized schedule, not a hand-built period/decision
result, realized_cost = run_scenario_realized(scenario)
assert realized_cost == pytest.approx(result.total_cost, ...)  # R == P
```

A unit test on the changed function directly (e.g. calling
`_apply_period_schedule` or `intra_period_discharge_gate` with stubbed
arguments) can pass while the new branch is unreachable by any real
DP-produced schedule — that is exactly the coverage gap that shipped
undetected in PR #385 (`docs/agents/simulator.md`). Add such a unit test only
as a supplement, never as the sole RED test, for this category of fix.

If the diagnosis's evidence is a user-supplied debug log/bundle, build the
scenario from that real data instead of a hand-assembled fixture:

```bash
python scripts/mock_ha/scenarios/from_debug_log.py <bundle.md>
```

(`docs/agents/testing.md` → Bug Reproduction with Mock HA). Do this before
writing the RED test — the bundle already contains the exact conditions that
reproduced the bug.

**If the fix changes optimizer economics or behavior, the fixture from
`from_debug_log.py --issue <N>` also needs its `expected_results`/
`expected_behavior` set from the fixed code's output** (`docs/agents/testing.md`
→ Test Data) — this wires it into `test_scenarios.py::test_all_scenarios`,
the codebase's existing auto-discovered, always-run regression harness for
every `*.json` fixture in `core/bess/tests/unit/data/`. Do this instead of
writing a standalone test file that re-derives `_scenario_inputs` and
hand-asserts cost numbers — that duplicates a mechanism the codebase already
has and runs on every test invocation. Verify the pin actually discriminates
(temporarily feed it the pre-fix/buggy input, confirm it fails) before
trusting it. Reserve a standalone test file for what that harness genuinely
can't express: a private method's internal formula, or plan-faithfulness
(`R == P`) — `test_all_scenarios` never runs the inverter simulator.

### 6. Quality gate + code review (background)

Every PR must pass both the fast and slow suites, plus code review. This is
the long-wait step (slow suite is ~30min) — per `CLAUDE.md`'s Cost
Discipline, do NOT hold the session open watching it run. Dispatch a
background `Agent` (no `isolation` — it must operate in the Step 4 worktree,
not spawn a new one; `run_in_background: true`, the default) with a
self-contained prompt covering:

1. `./scripts/quality-check.sh` (fast suite) — if it fails, fix and re-run,
   do not proceed with failures.
2. `.venv/bin/pytest -m slow` (slow suite) — same failure handling.
3. If the diff touches the DP, intent classification, or control/rate
   mapping (the Step 5 table): confirm the diff's new/changed tests include
   a `run_scenario_realized` / `verify_plan_faithfulness` call, not only a
   unit test on the changed function with hand-built arguments. If missing,
   this is a required-before-continuing gap, not a nice-to-have — report it
   as a blocking finding alongside the suite results, same severity as a
   failing test.
4. Invoke the `code-review` skill on the diff.
5. Report back: pass/fail on both suites, whether check 3 passed, and any
   CONFIRMED code-review
   findings verbatim (everything else goes to `TODO.md`).

Do not poll — you'll be notified on completion. This is a hard session
boundary: don't keep re-touching the diagnosis/TDD context while it runs.

### 7. Confirm gate 2 (manual — mandatory)

Present the background agent's report to the user: suite results and any
CONFIRMED findings. Fix CONFIRMED findings in the same worktree before
continuing. Wait for explicit go-ahead before Step 8 — same reasoning as
Step 3, cheap insurance against shipping a finding-blocked or slow-suite-
broken change.

### 8. Local run & observe (never skip this)

Invoke the `verify` skill: actually exercise the fix and capture real
output — the reproducing mock-HA scenario via
`docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml`, a dev-server flow for frontend
changes, or the relevant CLI/pytest path with output inspected, not just its
exit code. A green test suite is necessary, not sufficient — this step is
what makes this skill worth running instead of the bot pipeline, and it is
not satisfied by re-stating that `quality-check.sh` passed.

### 9. Commit + draft PR

Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]` (create that heading at
the top if it's not already there), in the matching `### Added` / `### Changed`
/ `### Fixed` subsection — one line, per `docs/agents/workflow.md`'s CHANGELOG
Format (bold lead-in, issue/PR link, ~25-word cap; no root cause or
file/function names — that's the PR description's job, not the changelog's).
Match existing entries' *format* only, never their *length* — several past
entries are multi-sentence root-cause essays; do not use those as a length
precedent. This is a normal part of the PR, not a release
step — per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-release-workflow-design.md`,
`Unreleased` entries accumulate as each PR merges; the release skill only
ever renames or copies that section, it never authors it. Skipping this here
means the release skill has to backfill it later from a colder context.

**Documentation check (mandatory, not optional):** if the fix changed a
mechanism, formula, threshold, or code path that `docs/agents/bess-knowledge.md`
or `docs/SOFTWARE_DESIGN.md` describes, update the affected section in this
same PR. These two files are read as ground truth by the AI chat, the
GitHub analysis agent, and future implementers — a removed/changed mechanism
left undocumented silently rots into a wrong answer later (found in practice:
a "Bellman-optimality guardrail removal" refactor left both docs describing a
profit-threshold gate and a reward floor that no longer existed, and a FIFO
cost-basis claim that was never true). Concretely: grep both files for any
function/field/formula your diff touches before opening the PR, not after.
If neither file mentions anything your change touches, say so explicitly in
the PR description rather than silently skipping — a reviewer shouldn't have
to guess whether it was checked.

Commit per `docs/agents/workflow.md` format (subject + blank line + body
explaining WHY). Open a draft PR against `main` via
`superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` (Option 2: push + PR), body:

```
## Summary
- <bullet>

## Root cause
<quote from the Step 2 diagnosis>

## Fix
<what changed and why>

## Test plan
- [ ] `./scripts/quality-check.sh` passes locally (already done)
- [ ] <what you actually observed in Step 8 — be concrete>

Closes #<n>
```

### 10. Hard constraints

- Draft PR only. Never auto-merge.
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Do NOT modify the version in `bess_manager/config.yaml` — bumping it is a
  release-time step, not a per-PR one. DO add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under
  `## [Unreleased]` per Step 9 — this is the one CHANGELOG.md edit expected
  in every PR.
- If `quality-check.sh` keeps failing after 3 fix attempts, or Step 8 can't
  demonstrate the fix actually works, stop, push the branch as-is, and
  report what failed — don't force a PR through.
- If this work went through `superpowers:writing-plans` (a `docs/superpowers/plans/`
  file exists for it), delete that plan file before the Step 9 commit. Keep
  the spec (if any); the plan is execution scaffolding that only drifts once
  the code is the source of truth. Never commit a plan doc into the PR.

## After Merge

A **separate, later invocation** — often a different session, sometimes days
later once CI is green and the user has reviewed. Not part of the numbered
flow above, which stops at draft-PR-open per the Step 10 constraints.

1. Confirm the merge:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit
   ```

   `state == "MERGED"` is authoritative — that's the standard signal, no need
   to separately diff branch content against `main`. Squash merges break
   `git branch -d`'s normal ancestry check (the branch's commits never become
   reachable from `main`), so force-delete below is expected, not a sign
   something's wrong.

2. Remove the worktree — via `ExitWorktree action=remove discard_changes=true`
   if the session is still in it, or `git worktree remove <path>` from the
   main repo root for a `.worktrees/`-created one.

3. Force-delete the local branch and prune stale remote refs:

   ```bash
   git branch -D <branch-name>
   git fetch origin --prune
   ```

   GitHub auto-deletes the remote branch on merge by default; `--prune` just
   clears the now-stale local tracking ref.

## Rationalizations — Reality

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "quality-check.sh passed, that's enough" | Green tests prove the suite is satisfied, not that the fix behaves correctly against the real scenario. Step 8 requires observed output, every time. |
| "the diagnosis is obviously right, skip the confirm gate" | Wrong diagnoses are exactly when confidence is highest. One message, cheap insurance. |
| "I'll clean up this other thing while I'm in here" | Out of scope. Minimal fix only. |
| "code review can wait until after I've verified it works" | Reordered on purpose — catch cheap issues before spending time on manual verification, not after. |
| "there's already a bot diagnosis, let me re-derive it anyway to be safe" | Re-verify the cited evidence; don't redo the whole investigation. |
| "the plan doc is useful context, keep it in the PR" | Once code and tests exist, the plan only drifts — it's not the source of truth. Delete it before Step 9; keep the spec if one exists. |
| "the user is in a hurry, just open the PR" | Time pressure from the user is not permission to skip Step 8 — it's the reason to say so explicitly and give a real ETA instead. |
| "I'll just watch the background agent run" | Defeats the point — the whole reason it's backgrounded is so the session isn't held open through the slow suite. Let the notification bring you back. |
| "the fix is small, docs don't need touching" | Small fixes are exactly what silently invalidates a one-line doc claim (a removed threshold, a renamed formula). Grep the two design docs before opening the PR, every time. |
| "a unit test on the changed function is enough" | Not for DP/intent/control-mapping changes — a synthetic-input unit test can pass while the new branch is unreachable by any real optimizer-derived scenario. `docs/agents/simulator.md` requires `R == P` for exactly this class of change. |
| "the existing suite still passes, so nothing broke" | Passing unchanged means the new code path may simply be untested, not unbroken — check whether any existing fixture actually reaches the new branch before treating a green suite as coverage. |

## Red Flags — Stop and Go Back

- About to commit or open the PR without having actually run/observed the
  fix — only ran automated tests.
- About to skip the Step 3 or Step 7 confirm gate because of time pressure.
- About to open the PR before `/code-review` CONFIRMED findings are
  resolved.
- About to re-run the full `bess-analyst` diagnosis when a verified bot
  comment already exists.
- About to run the slow suite inline in the main session instead of
  dispatching the Step 6 background agent.
- About to open the PR without checking whether the fix invalidates a claim
  in `docs/agents/bess-knowledge.md` or `docs/SOFTWARE_DESIGN.md`.
- About to write only a synthetic-input unit test for a DP/intent/control-
  mapping change instead of a plan-faithfulness (`R == P`) scenario test.
- About to write a repro test from hand-built data when a user debug log/
  bundle is available and `from_debug_log.py` could build it from real data.
