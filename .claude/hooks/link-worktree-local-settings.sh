# WorktreeCreate hook.
#
# `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored (globally, via
# `**/.claude/settings.local.json`), so it exists ONLY in the main checkout.
# `.claude/settings.json` and everything under `.claude/hooks/` are tracked
# and travel into a worktree for free -- local settings do not.
#
# The asymmetry is silent and it bites hard: the moment a session enters a
# worktree it loses every permission rule and mode set in local settings,
# while the tracked `ask:` list keeps applying. A run that was fully
# autonomous in the main checkout starts prompting inside the worktree, for
# rules the user thought they had already relaxed.
#
# This symlinks the main checkout's local settings into every linked
# worktree that lacks them. A symlink (not a copy) so later edits in the
# main checkout apply everywhere without re-running anything.
#
# It sweeps all linked worktrees rather than trusting a payload field for
# "the worktree that was just created": the sweep is idempotent, needs no
# assumption about the hook's stdin shape, and self-heals worktrees that
# predate this hook.
#
# Registered on two events, because there are two ways a worktree appears:
#   WorktreeCreate -- native creation (EnterWorktree / --worktree). Fires
#     before the session enters, so the link is in place when settings load.
#   SessionStart   -- covers `git worktree add`, the git fallback path in
#     superpowers:using-git-worktrees, which fires no WorktreeCreate at all.
#     Settings are already loaded by the time SessionStart runs, so a
#     fallback-created worktree picks its link up on its NEXT session; the
#     fleet-wide sweep is what makes that self-correcting rather than
#     permanent.
#
# Scope note: .venv and frontend/node_modules have the same
# doesn't-travel problem, but they are scripts/worktree-setup.sh's job
# (issue #556). This hook stays limited to the permissions concern.
