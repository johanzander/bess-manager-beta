# Energy Management System Improvements - Prioritized Implementation Plan


## 🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY** (System Reliability)

### 0. **Fix Battery Discharge Power Control Bug**

**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Growatt inverter control

**Description**: Discharge power seems to always be 100% leading to higher export than intended during BATTERY_EXPORT operations.

### **Charging power rate setting has no effect**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `inverter_controller.py`, `battery_system_manager.py`, `power_monitor.py`

**Description**: The `charging_power_rate` setting (default 40%) is overridden every cycle by `adjust_charging_power()`, which reads `charge_rate` from `INTENT_TO_CONTROL` — always 0 or 100. The configured value is only used as the initial `target_charging_power_pct` in `HomePowerMonitor`, but is immediately overwritten by the first `adjust_charging_power()` call. This affects all platforms.

**User-reported symptom**: Log shows "charging power 40%" but the inverter always charges at 100%.

**Options to consider**:
1. Remove the setting entirely if per-intent 0/100 is the intended design (and update UI to not show a configurable value)
2. Use the setting as an actual cap: `charge_rate = min(intent_charge_rate, configured_rate)`
3. Make `INTENT_TO_CONTROL` use the configured rate instead of hardcoded 100 for charging intents

**Files**: `core/bess/inverter_controller.py` (lines 33-47), `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py` (lines 2538-2548), `core/bess/power_monitor.py` (line 67), `core/bess/settings.py` (line 54)

## 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY** (Core Functionality)

### **Add SolaX Modbus inverter support**

**Impact**: High | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Inverter abstraction layer, `GrowattScheduleManager`

**Description**: Add support for the [homeassistant-solax-modbus](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus) integration alongside the existing Growatt integration. This would allow BESS Manager to be used with SolaX inverters, significantly expanding the supported hardware.

**Implementation**:

- Introduce an inverter abstraction layer (interface/protocol) that `GrowattScheduleManager` and a new `SolaXScheduleManager` both implement
- Implement `SolaXScheduleManager` using SolaX Modbus entities for TOU schedule deployment and battery mode control
- Add inverter type selection to settings (`config.yaml`, `BatterySettings`, setup wizard)
- Route schedule deployment through the selected inverter manager in `BatterySystemManager`
- Verify sensor mapping: SolaX entities for battery SOC, charge/discharge power, and grid import/export may differ from Growatt names
- Update health checks to validate the correct inverter entities based on selected type
- Add SolaX-specific documentation to `docs/INSTALLATION.md`

**Files**: `core/bess/growatt_schedule_manager.py` (extract interface), new `core/bess/solax_schedule_manager.py`, `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py`, `core/bess/settings.py`, `backend/settings_store.py`, `config.yaml`

---

### **Surface Inverter Max AC Power in the setup wizard**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `SetupWizardPage.tsx`

**Description**: `inverter_max_ac_power_kw` (PR #305) caps combined solar + discharge AC output at the inverter's rated power, preventing over-discharge plans on hybrid inverters — but it's opt-in (default 0/disabled) and currently only surfaced in Settings → Battery, not the setup wizard. Issue #304 (ridax67) hit exactly this — a planned discharge exceeding the inverter's 10kW AC limit — and had to be told about the setting after the fact. New users are unlikely to discover it unless they hit the symptom first.

**Implementation**: Add the `inverterMaxAcPowerKw` / `inverterAcPowerMargin` fields to the battery step of `SetupWizardPage.tsx`, likely alongside other inverter-rating fields, with a short explanation of when to set it (hybrid/DC-coupled inverters where solar + discharge can exceed the inverter's AC rating).

**Files**: `frontend/src/pages/SetupWizardPage.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/settings/BatteryFormSection.tsx` (for reference on existing field wiring)

---

### **Rename `strategic_intent` to `battery_intent` throughout the codebase**

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `decision_intelligence.py`, `dp_battery_algorithm.py`, `sph_schedule.py`, `models.py`, frontend

**Description**: The term "strategic intent" has been replaced with "battery intent" in the software design document. Rename accordingly in code:

- `StrategicIntent` enum → `BatteryIntent` (`dp_battery_algorithm.py`)
- `strategic_intent` field → `battery_intent` in `DecisionData` (`models.py`)
- All assignments and references in `decision_intelligence.py`, `sph_schedule.py`, `battery_system_manager.py`, and any API serialization
- Frontend: any display label or type referencing `strategicIntent` / `strategic_intent`

### **Minor cleanup from issue #201 (stale health-check banner) fix**

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `core/bess/influxdb_helper.py`, `backend/api.py`

**Description**: A few small, non-blocking cleanups identified during code review of the #201 fix:

- `get_sensor_data_batch` and `get_power_sensor_data_batch` (`core/bess/influxdb_helper.py`) each have their own copy of the `if not is_influxdb_configured(): ...` early-return guard — could be factored into a shared decorator/helper if a third call site appears.
- `GET /api/system-health` and `POST /api/system-health/recheck` (`backend/api.py`) share the same `_require_configured_system` + health-check + `convert_keys_to_camel_case` + `HTTPException(500)` shape, differing only in whether the result is cached. Worth revisiting if a third variant is ever needed.
- The new 5-minute health-check cron job (`backend/app.py`) also re-runs `test_influxdb_connection()` for the subset of users who *do* have InfluxDB configured (it correctly skips for everyone else). This is intentional — same cadence agreed for the dashboard banner — but worth knowing if InfluxDB load ever becomes a complaint.

### **Investigate redundant `power` gate in strategic intent detection**

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `decision_intelligence.py`, `dp_battery_algorithm.py`

**Description**: In `create_decision_data` (`decision_intelligence.py`), strategic intent is determined by an outer `power < -0.1` / `power > 0.1` check followed by inner energy flow checks (`battery_to_grid`, `grid_to_battery`). The `power` check is likely redundant: the detailed flows in `EnergyData` are derived automatically via `_calculate_detailed_flows()` from `battery_charged`/`battery_discharged`, so if `power < -0.1` then `battery_discharged > 0` and the flow checks already handle the distinction. The inner flow thresholds (0.1 kWh) also provide the same noise filtering as the outer power threshold. Verify whether the outer `power` gate can be removed and intent determined solely from energy flows.



### 1. **Improve Battery SOC and Actions Component**

**Impact**: Medium-High | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend cost calculations

**Description**: Core feature enhancement showing detailed battery optimization reasoning

**Current State**: `BatteryLevelChart.tsx` exists with SOC and battery action visualization. Missing: cost breakdown table and actual/predicted timeline split.

**Implementation**:

- **Add actual/predicted timeline split** with visual distinction
- **Add detailed cost breakdown table**:

```text
  Base case cost:     65.69 SEK (Actual: 27.06 + Predicted: 38.63)
  Grid cost:         -14.90 SEK (Actual: 28.13 + Predicted: -43.03)
  Battery wear cost:   9.89 SEK (Actual: 2.60 + Predicted: 7.29)
  Total savings:      80.59 SEK (Actual: -1.07 + Predicted: 81.67)
```

**Technical Tasks**:

- Update `BatteryLevelChart.tsx` for actual/predicted split
- Create cost breakdown table component
- Add hover tooltips with detailed calculations
- Integrate with backend hourly cost data

---

### 2. **Complete Decision Intelligence Implementation**

> **Superseded — do not start.** See "Scrap the Decision Intelligence framework"
> under TECHNICAL DEBT. The recommendation is to delete this path, not finish it.

**Impact**: Medium-High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `decision_intelligence.py`, `sensor_collector.py`, `dp_battery_algorithm.py`

**Vision**: Transform the DP battery optimization from a "black box" into a transparent, educational system that helps users understand complex energy economics and multi-hour optimization strategies. Users should see real SEK values for each energy pathway and understand *why* the optimizer made each decision — not just what it decided.

**What is working** (future/predicted hours only):

- Advanced flow pattern recognition: `SOLAR_TO_HOME_AND_BATTERY`, `GRID_TO_HOME_PLUS_BATTERY_TO_GRID`, etc.
- Economic chain explanations: multi-hour strategy reasoning with real SEK values
- Future target hours: identifies when arbitrage opportunities occur
- Frontend `DecisionFramework.tsx` component is complete and consuming enhanced data

**Gap 1: Historical hours show fallback values**

Past periods (already executed) still show:

- `advanced_flow_pattern: "NO_PATTERN_DETECTED"`
- `detailed_flow_values: {}`
- `economic_chain: "Historical data - basic strategic intent"`

Root cause: the historical data pipeline (`SensorCollector` → `HistoricalDataStore`) does not run through `decision_intelligence.py`. Fix: apply `create_decision_data()` when recording historical periods, using actual energy flow data and prices from that period.

**Gap 2: Future economic values showing 0.00 SEK**

Future arbitrage calculations (the "expected arbitrage value" in economic chain explanations) show 0.00 SEK. Needs investigation in DP algorithm economic chain value computation and how future target hour values are propagated.

**Files**: `core/bess/decision_intelligence.py`, `core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py`, `core/bess/sensor_collector.py`, `frontend/src/components/DecisionFramework.tsx`

---

### 3. **Move Relevant Parts of Daily Summary to Dashboard**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: Dashboard layout

**Current State**: `SavingsPage` contains energy independence metrics that belong on Dashboard

**Implementation**:

- **Extract Energy Independence Card**: Self-sufficiency %, Grid independence time, Solar utilization %
- **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate redundant cost/savings between Dashboard and Savings pages

**Technical Tasks**:

- Create `EnergyIndependenceCard.tsx` component
- Extract logic from `SavingsPage.tsx`
- Add to `DashboardPage.tsx`
- Remove duplicate information

---

### 5. **Enhance Insights Page with Decision Detail**

> **Blocked on the same decision.** See "Scrap the Decision Intelligence
> framework" under TECHNICAL DEBT. The goal (explain DP decisions to users) is
> still valid; the vehicle should be the AI chat panel, not another orphaned
> component. Do not start before that decision lands.

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend decision logging

**Current State**: `InsightsPage.tsx` renders `PredictionAnalysisView` but lacks decision reasoning, algorithm transparency, and confidence metrics

**Implementation**:

- **Add detailed decision analysis**: Why each battery action was chosen
- **Algorithm transparency**: DP optimization steps, price arbitrage reasoning
- **Alternative scenarios**: Options considered, confidence metrics

**Technical Tasks**:

- Extend backend to capture decision reasoning
- Create decision timeline component
- Add interactive decision trees
- Include confidence metrics display

---

### 6. **Demo Mode for Users Without Configured Sensors**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Backend architecture, Mock data

**Description**: Allow users to run and explore the system without requiring fully configured Home Assistant sensors. This enables evaluation, development, and troubleshooting scenarios.

**Implementation**:

- **Enhanced mock data generation**: Create realistic synthetic energy data, battery states, and pricing
- **Demo mode toggle**: Configuration option to enable full demo mode vs partial sensor availability
- **Graceful degradation**: System operates with missing sensors using reasonable defaults
- **Demo data scenarios**: Multiple realistic scenarios (high solar, EV charging, peak pricing days)
- **Visual indicators**: Clear UI indication when running in demo/mock mode

**Benefits**: Users can evaluate the system before full HA integration, developers can test without hardware, easier onboarding experience

**Current State**: `ha_api_controller.py` has a basic `test_mode` / `set_test_mode()` infrastructure but no synthetic data generation or UI indicators.

**Technical Tasks**:

- Extend existing test mode functionality in `ha_api_controller.py`
- Create comprehensive mock data generators for all sensor types
- Add demo mode configuration to `config.yaml`
- Update frontend to show demo mode indicators
- Ensure optimization algorithms work with mock data

## 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY** (Polish)

### 7. Add Prediction accuracy and history

### 8. Intent is not always correct for historical data

**Current State**: The inverter sometimes charges/discharges small amounts like 0.1kW. Or its a rounding error or inefficiencies losses when calculating flows. I don't think its a strategic intent, but it is interpreted as one.

### **Make ha_statistics consumption forecast work on all platforms**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `battery_system_manager.py`, `ha_api_controller.py`

**Description**: The `ha_statistics` consumption forecast strategy currently requires a native `lifetime_load_consumption` HA entity to query HA Recorder statistics. Platforms without this entity (GEN4 Growatt Modbus, SolaX Native) fall back to the `fixed` profile, losing the time-of-day shaped consumption forecast.

**Fix**: Instead of querying a single load consumption entity, query the 3 universal sensors (`lifetime_solar_energy`, `lifetime_import_from_grid`, `lifetime_export_to_grid`) and derive load per hour: `load = solar_change + import_change - export_change`. Same physics, works on every platform.

**Files**: `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py` (`_get_ha_statistics_forecast`)

### **Change default consumption_strategy from `sensor` to `ha_statistics`**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `settings.py`, `settings_store.py`

**Description**: The default `consumption_strategy` is still `sensor` (the legacy grid-import proxy that ignores solar self-consumption and requires a hand-written template sensor). `ha_statistics` is more accurate and needs no manual sensor setup, so it should be the default. Depends on `ha_statistics` working on all platforms (see above) so the default doesn't silently fall back to `fixed`.

**Fix**: Change `DEFAULT` / `consumption_strategy` default to `ha_statistics` in `core/bess/settings.py:183` and the settings-store defaults; update `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` (currently labels `sensor` as "(default)").

**Files**: `core/bess/settings.py`, `backend/settings_store.py`, `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`

## 🔵 **ROBUSTNESS IMPROVEMENTS** (System Observability)

### **Retry discovery on startup when HA WebSocket is not ready**

**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `ha_api_controller.py`, `battery_system_manager.py`

**Description**: BESS Manager starts as an HA add-on and can launch before HA's WebSocket API is fully ready. When the initial `discover_integrations()` WS connection fails during early boot, `nordpool_config_entry_id` stays None and the system enters degraded mode with no price data — even though HA becomes ready seconds later. Observed on Niklas's system (b18, 2026-05-26): WS failed at 05:08 (4 min after boot), but by 05:45 discovery worked fine.

**Fix**: Re-attempt discovery with short backoff (e.g. 5s, 10s, 20s) until `config_entry_id` is populated or a max number of retries is reached.

---

### **Improve InfluxDB Health Check to Verify Sensor Coverage**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: `health_check.py`, `influxdb_helper.py`

**Problem**: The "Historical Data Access" health check reports OK as long as InfluxDB is reachable and the bucket contains *any* row. It uses a `limit(n: 1)` probe — equivalent to pinging the database. It does not verify that the specific sensors the BESS system needs are actually present. As a result, it reported OK on 2026-04-03 even though 4 of 10 required sensors had no data in InfluxDB.

**Note**: A sensor showing value 0 (e.g. `battery_input_energy` at day start) is valid — cumulative sensors legitimately start at 0. The check must verify **existence** (any data point in past 7 days), not recent non-zero values.

**Current behavior** (`influxdb_helper.py:test_influxdb_connection()`):

```flux
from(bucket: "...")
  |> range(start: -24h)
  |> limit(n: 1)
```

Passes if *any* measurement returns a row. No knowledge of which sensors were found.

**Desired behavior**:

For each sensor configured in the BESS system (from `METHOD_SENSOR_MAP`), run a targeted query:

```flux
from(bucket: "...")
  |> range(start: -7d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["entity_id"] == "sensor.battery_input_energy")
  |> limit(n: 1)
```

Report:

- **OK**: all core sensors found in InfluxDB
- **WARNING**: optional sensors missing (configured but no InfluxDB data)
- **ERROR**: core energy sensors missing (battery, grid, consumption)

**Technical Tasks**:

- Extend `test_influxdb_connection()` to accept a list of entity IDs to probe
- Pass the configured sensor entity IDs from `METHOD_SENSOR_MAP` (or a defined "core" subset)
- Return per-sensor results so `check_historical_data_access()` can report which sensors are missing
- Distinguish core sensors (battery_input_energy, battery_output_energy, grid_import, grid_export, load_energy) from optional (ev_energy_meter, solar forecasts)
- Surface missing optional sensors as WARNING, missing core sensors as ERROR
- This will make "Historical Data Access" reflect actual data availability, not just connectivity

## 🔵 **KNOWN ISSUES** (From Code Review — 2026-06-24)

### Event Loop Blocking in demo→live Transition

**Impact**: Low (only at mode switch) | **Effort**: Medium

**Description**: `BatterySystemManager.set_demo_mode()` (formerly `reinitialize_tou_schedule()`) is called directly inside the `async def patch_settings` handler. On the demo→live transition it runs `_initialize_tou_schedule_from_inverter()` + `initialize_hardware()`, blocking the event loop while performing up to 36 synchronous HTTP calls to Home Assistant (reading all 9 TOU slots × 4 entities each). Should be offloaded to a background thread or thread pool executor.

**File**: `backend/api.py` — `patch_settings` / `setup_complete`, `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py` — `set_demo_mode`, `core/bess/ha_api_controller.py` — `read_tou_segments_from_entities`

---

### Startup Race: Concurrent `_initialize_tou_schedule_from_inverter` Calls

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low

**Description**: `BatterySystemManager.start()` calls `_initialize_tou_schedule_from_inverter()` at startup (`battery_system_manager.py:533`), and the same path is triggered again by `set_demo_mode(False)` (`battery_system_manager.py:574`, formerly `reinitialize_tou_schedule()`) when switching demo→live. There is no threading lock protecting against concurrent calls. If both happen in rapid succession (fast live switch during startup), both threads may issue overlapping hardware writes.

**File**: `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py`

---

## 🔄 **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS** (From Historical Design Analysis)

### 10. **Machine Learning Predictions**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Historical data, ML framework

**Description**: ML-based consumption and solar predictions to improve optimization accuracy beyond current HA sensor forecasts.

**Implementation**:

- Integrate with existing PredictionProvider framework
- Historical data analysis for pattern recognition (weather, season, usage patterns)
- Adaptive prediction models with confidence scoring
- Accuracy tracking and model performance metrics

### 11. **Performance Monitoring and Metrics**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Analytics framework

**Description**: Comprehensive performance tracking for optimization effectiveness and system reliability.

**Implementation**:

- Optimization accuracy tracking (predicted vs actual savings)
- Battery performance degradation monitoring
- Energy balance validation metrics and alerts
- Component timing and performance metrics collection
- Automated reporting and alerting for anomalies

### 12. **Data Export and Analysis Tools**

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Data stores

**Description**: Export capabilities for external analysis and system backup.

**Implementation**:

- JSON/CSV export of historical energy data and optimization decisions
- Configuration backup/restore functionality
- Optimization decision logs with reasoning export
- Integration with external analytics tools (Grafana, etc.)

## 🟠 **POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### Full Arbitrage Cycle Savings Display

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: models.py, savings page UI

**Description**: The savings table shows per-hour P&L (`solar_only_cost - hourly_cost`). This is correct and honest, but charging hours show negative savings and discharge savings appear in later hours (or the next day for overnight cycles). The daily total can appear negative when charging happened today but discharge is scheduled for tomorrow.

**Idea**: Add a "full cycle savings" summary somewhere in the savings page or dashboard that aggregates completed charge→discharge cycles and shows the net arbitrage profit per cycle. This would complement the existing per-hour P&L without changing the underlying formula.

### Optimizer vs Dashboard Savings Baseline Mismatch

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: DP algorithm, models.py, daily_view_builder

**Description**: The optimizer and dashboard use different baselines for calculating savings, which causes confusing discrepancies between predicted and actual savings numbers.

**The Two Calculations**:

| | Optimizer (`dp_battery_algorithm.py:897-906`) | Dashboard (`models.py:231-242`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | Grid-only: `consumption × buy_price` | Solar-only: `(consumption - solar) × buy_price - excess_solar × sell_price` |
| **Solar in baseline?** | No — set to zero (`solar_only_cost=total_base_cost, # Simplified`) | Yes — uses real solar production data |
| **Formula** | `total_base_cost - total_optimized_cost` | `solar_only_cost - hourly_cost` |
| **Used for** | Profitability gate decision (line 933) | Dashboard `total_savings` display |

**Why This Matters**:

The dashboard metric is correct — it answers "did the battery save money vs just having solar?" The optimizer's metric conflates solar savings with battery savings. When the optimizer reports +46 SEK, that includes value from solar production that you'd earn regardless of battery operation.

**Concrete Risk**: The profitability gate (`grid_to_battery_solar_savings < min_action_profit_threshold`) compares against the grid-only baseline. On sunny days with high solar production, this could approve battery schedules that appear profitable (because solar savings are included) but are actually unprofitable when measured by the dashboard's correct solar-only baseline.

In winter (low solar), the impact is negligible since both baselines converge. In summer (high solar), the optimizer could systematically overestimate battery profitability.

**Potential Fix**: Change the optimizer's `total_base_cost` to use the solar-only baseline:

```python
# Current (grid-only baseline):
total_base_cost = sum(home_consumption[i] * buy_price[i] for i in range(len(buy_price)))

# Proposed (solar-only baseline - matches dashboard):
total_base_cost = sum(
    max(0, home_consumption[i] - solar_production[i]) * buy_price[i]
    - max(0, solar_production[i] - home_consumption[i]) * sell_price[i]
    for i in range(len(buy_price))
)
```

This would make the profitability gate compare apples-to-apples with the dashboard savings, and prevent approving battery operations that lose money relative to the solar-only baseline.

---

## 🧪 **TEST FRAMEWORK IMPROVEMENTS**

### Unify and strengthen test infrastructure

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `core/bess/tests/unit/`, `backend/tests/`

**Description**: The test suite has grown organically and would benefit from a coherent structure. Currently:

- **Scenario tests** (`test_scenarios.py`) use JSON data files and only assert on economic summary values (`base_cost`, `battery_solar_cost`, `savings`, `savings_pct`). They cannot express behavioral assertions like "the optimizer should choose SOLAR_STORAGE over IDLE."
- **Standalone tests** (`test_idle_solar_charging.py`, `test_terminal_value.py`) test behavioral properties but live outside the scenario framework, duplicating setup boilerplate.
- **Backend tests** (`backend/tests/`) cover API conversion, settings contracts, and settings store but are disconnected from core algorithm tests.

**What to improve**:

- Extend the scenario framework to support **behavioral assertions** (strategic intent distribution, constraint validation) alongside economic assertions — so new regression tests like issue #73 can be expressed as scenario JSON files with richer `expected_results`
- Add a shared fixture or helper for constructing `BatterySettings` + running `optimize_battery_schedule`, reducing boilerplate across standalone tests
- Consider supporting both hourly and quarterly resolution scenarios (currently all scenarios are hourly, but real optimization runs at 15-min resolution)
- Review whether backend integration tests should exercise the full optimization→API pipeline end-to-end

**Files**: `core/bess/tests/unit/test_scenarios.py`, `core/bess/tests/unit/data/*.json`, `core/bess/tests/conftest.py`, `backend/tests/`

---

### Pinned scenario fixtures never exercise a realistic (nonzero) terminal value

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium-High | **Dependencies**: `core/bess/tests/unit/test_scenarios.py`, `core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py`, `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py`

**Description**: `optimize_battery_schedule()` defaults `terminal_value_per_kwh=0.0`, and every one of the ~26 pinned scenarios in `test_scenarios.py` calls it without overriding that default — so the entire pinned-fixture regression suite always tests the DP with terminal value hardcoded to zero, regardless of what each scenario's horizon is meant to represent. In production, every real optimization run computes a nonzero terminal value via `_calculate_terminal_value()` (`battery_system_manager.py`). Found while investigating #345 (terminal-value zeroing at the extended horizon boundary): CI stayed green through that fix specifically because nothing in the pinned suite touches this code path at all, in either direction.

**What to improve**: Retrofit the pinned scenarios to compute their terminal value the same way production does (`_calculate_terminal_value`'s median-buy/sell-cap formula, applied to each scenario's own price data) instead of silently defaulting to zero, then re-pin each scenario's expected cost against the new baseline.

**Why not done as part of #345**: per the CHANGELOG history, changes to this exact mechanism have previously shifted "nearly every scenario's expected schedule" — retrofitting all 26 fixtures is a broad, independently risky change that conflates two different concerns ("is `_calculate_terminal_value`'s formula correct" vs. "does the DP correctly handle *some* nonzero terminal value") and shouldn't ride along with a narrow bug fix. #345/#347 instead added one new targeted pinned fixture for the extended-horizon mechanism specifically, without touching the other 26.

**Files**: `core/bess/tests/unit/test_scenarios.py`, `core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:1313-1327` (`optimize_battery_schedule` signature/default), `core/bess/battery_system_manager.py` (`_calculate_terminal_value`)

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DEBT**

### Scrap the Decision Intelligence framework

**Impact**: Medium (removes ~2000 lines of unreachable code) | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: none — nothing routed consumes it

**Decision**: the *goal* (explain DP decisions to users, because backward
induction is opaque) is valid and unmet. This *implementation* should go. It
narrates the chosen action from its own energy flows — a restatement of numbers
the actions table already shows — rather than the counterfactual the user
actually wants ("why 02:00 and not 03:00", "why 80% and not 100%"). The DP
evaluated those alternatives; the framework never captured the comparison.

Evidence it was never load-bearing: `future_value` — the one field carrying
anything the user could not already see — was hardcoded `0.0` until #353 fixed
it in 2026, and nobody noticed, because nothing rendered it. Two orphaned
attempts at the same feature (`DecisionFramework.tsx`,
`TableBatteryDecisionExplorer.tsx`) were never routed in `App.tsx`.

**What did work, and why**: PR #358 (`visualize-debug-log` skill, still open on
`feat/visualize-debug-log-skill`) is the successful version — for *maintainers*,
not end users. It renders `shadow_price` against the price it is actually weighed
against, `cost_basis` + cycle cost as a breakeven, and `reward + future_value` as
"total value (top candidate)". That is the **counterfactual** framing this
framework never had: what the DP compared, not a retelling of what it chose. It
also deliberately skips `immediate_value`, with a comment saying it duplicates the
dashboard's Net Grid Cost / Net Savings. Keep that as the model if the end-user
version is ever attempted: show the comparison, not the narration.

**Delete**:

- `frontend/src/components/DecisionFramework.tsx` (608 lines, imported by nothing)
- `frontend/src/lib/decisionIntelligenceAPI.tsx` (33 lines)
- `frontend/src/components/TableBatteryDecisionExplorer.tsx` (imported by nothing)
- `frontend/src/types/decisionFramework.tsx` (`FlowPattern`,
  `DecisionIntelligenceResponse`) — imported *only* by `DecisionFramework.tsx:22`
  and `decisionIntelligenceAPI.tsx:4`, both deleted above, so it becomes a new
  orphan if left behind
- `backend/api.py`: `convert_real_data_to_mock_format` (876-1034),
  `get_decision_intelligence` + the `/api/decision-intelligence` route
  (1037-1084), `get_decision_intelligence_mock` (1086-1509 — 424 lines of
  hardcoded demo prices with its route decorator already commented out)
- `core/bess/decision_intelligence.py`: `generate_advanced_flow_pattern_name`,
  `generate_strategic_pattern_name`, `generate_flow_description`,
  `generate_economic_chain`, `calculate_detailed_flow_values` — all have
  **zero** references outside the module once the above is gone
- `core/bess/decision_intelligence.py`: `extract_economic_values_from_reward`
  — **delete only together with the replacement below.** It is the sole
  producer of `future_value`, which the Keep list requires. Removing it
  without a replacement silently reverts `future_value` to its `0.0` default
  and reintroduces exactly the regression #353 fixed.

  **Replacement**: assign `continuation_value` to `future_value` directly.
  The two are already algebraically identical — `_compute_reward` builds
  `reward = -(import_cost - export_revenue + battery_wear_cost)`
  (`dp_battery_algorithm.py:795-796`), which *is*
  `extract_economic_values_from_reward`'s `immediate_value`
  (`decision_intelligence.py:413`), so
  `future_value = reward - immediate_value` (`:418`) collapses to precisely
  the `continuation_value` that `dp_battery_algorithm.py:809` adds in. The
  extractor is a no-op round trip. `create_decision_data` should take
  `continuation_value` and set `future_value=continuation_value`, dropping
  its `reward`/`import_cost`/`export_revenue`/`battery_wear_cost` parameters
  along with `immediate_value`.

  **Ripples of that swap**: `dp_battery_algorithm.py:804-809`'s invariant
  comment explains the round trip by name and must go with it; the call site
  at `:798-812` already has `continuation_value` in scope (`:709`, passed at
  `:1755`), so nothing new needs plumbing.
- `core/bess/models.py` `DecisionData` fields: `pattern_name`, `description`,
  `economic_chain`, `immediate_value`, `net_strategy_value`,
  `advanced_flow_pattern`, `detailed_flow_values`, `future_target_hours` —
  every consumer of these lives inside the deleted `api.py` block.
  **Not `future_value`** — see Keep.

**Keep** (live and load-bearing, despite sharing the module):

- `classify_strategic_intent()` — 19 external references; drives the TOU
  hardware mode via `INTENT_TO_CONTROL` and the intent badges in
  `BatteryActionsTable`. Has its own postmortems (#275, #282). Move it out of
  `decision_intelligence.py` into a module whose name reflects that it is
  control-path code, not reporting.
- `create_decision_data()`, reduced to the fields that survive.
- `DecisionData.strategic_intent`, `observed_intent`, `battery_action`,
  `cost_basis`, `shadow_price` (the last gates SOLAR_EXPORT discharge at
  `battery_system_manager.py:2659`; `cost_basis` and `shadow_price` are also
  both rendered by PR #358).
- **`DecisionData.future_value` and `_build_period_data`'s `continuation_value`
  parameter** — PR #358 consumes them: `total_value = reward + future_value`
  ("total value (top candidate)") plus a "future value / best achievable outcome
  from the resulting battery level onward" tooltip row. #353's fix stays. Keep
  `core/bess/tests/unit/test_decision_intelligence.py` (its regression test) too.

**Ripple**:

- `e2e/tests/api-smoke.spec.ts:38` and `e2e/tests/api-contracts.spec.ts:312`
  both assert on `/api/decision-intelligence` — delete those two blocks.
- `core/bess/tests/unit/test_data_models.py` asserts the removed fields in
  `TestDecisionData` (around lines 336-359) — trim to the surviving ones.
  **Also line 390**, in `TestPeriodData`, which constructs a `DecisionData`
  with `pattern_name=` outside that range; missing it fails the whole module
  at collection with `TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'pattern_name'`.
- **PR #358 coordination**: `build_chart.py` extracts `economic_chain` and
  `immediate_value` into its ROWS (two sites each, both `dec.get(...)` with
  defaults) but renders neither. Dropping those four lines plus the `ROWS`
  description in `SKILL.md` is the whole change there. Since #358 is still
  **open**, either land it first and clean up after, or fold the four-line
  removal into it — do not delete the fields while the PR is in flight without
  telling it.
- **Docs**: `docs/SOFTWARE_DESIGN.md:668` has a whole "Decision Intelligence
  API (`/api/decision-intelligence`)" section describing the deleted endpoint —
  remove it. Separately, moving `classify_strategic_intent()` out of
  `decision_intelligence.py` (see Keep) invalidates the path references in
  `docs/SOFTWARE_DESIGN.md:331`, `docs/ALGORITHM_EXPLAINED.md:252`,
  `docs/agents/bess-knowledge.md:230` and `:502`, and
  `docs/agents/simulator.md:47` — repoint them at the new module. Historical
  records under `docs/superpowers/` and `docs/agents/memory/` are
  point-in-time artefacts and stay as-is.
- No performance change: `create_decision_data` runs once per reconstructed
  period in `_build_period_data`, not in the DP inner loop.

**Retires** TODO items 2 and 5 and the #353 `immediate_value` note below.

**Cost of the decision**: none to #353 — its `future_value` fix and
continuation-value plumbing survive, because PR #358 renders them. What is lost
is only the templated narration and the two orphaned UIs.

**Where "explain the decision" lives afterwards**: PR #358's skill for
maintainers (bundle-level, counterfactual, already proven — it caught the
#342/#350 discrepancy), and the AI chat panel (`backend/ai_chat.py` +
`docs/agents/bess-knowledge.md`) for users, which can answer a specific question
at the depth asked instead of emitting a fixed string per intent. If a
user-facing UI is ever wanted, build it on #358's math, not on `economic_chain`.

### Decide the fate of `EnergySankeyChart.tsx`

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low (decision only)

**Description**: `frontend/src/components/EnergySankeyChart.tsx` is imported by
nothing — a third orphaned visualization alongside the two in the Decision
Intelligence scope above. Unlike those, it is **energy-flow visualization, not
decision explanation**, so it is a separate question and is deliberately left
in place for now: a Sankey of solar → home / battery / grid may still earn a
place on the Dashboard or Insights page in a way the decision-narration
components never could.

**Decide**: route it (Dashboard or Insights) or delete it. Do not let it drift
as a fourth orphan.

### Consolidate HistoricalDataStore, PredictionSnapshotStore, and DailyViewStore

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `core/bess/historical_data_store.py`, `core/bess/prediction_snapshot.py`, `core/bess/daily_view_store.py`

**Description**: The Daily Savings History feature (issue #126, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-09-daily-savings-history-design.md`) added a third `DailyView`/`PeriodData`-shaped store alongside the existing `HistoricalDataStore` (today-only, cleared nightly) and `PredictionSnapshotStore` (today-only, cleared nightly). All three persist overlapping period-level data with slightly different lifecycles. The new store deliberately kept its schema close to `DailyView`/`PeriodData` rather than inventing a divergent shape, specifically so this consolidation stays feasible later. No action taken now — noted for a future pass once the aggregate-savings feature has shipped and settled.

### SolaxController VPP behavior has fallen behind SolaxModbusGrowattController's VPP fixes

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `core/bess/solax_controller.py`, `core/bess/solax_modbus_growatt_controller.py`

**Description**: `SolaxController` (native SolaX inverters) and `SolaxModbusGrowattController` in `control_mode="vpp"` (Growatt via solax_modbus) both drive hardware through the same conceptual VPP power + remote-control model, but two Growatt-specific hardware fixes were never ported to SolaX: (1) #355's SOLAR_EXPORT grid-first hold (`block_passive_charging` -- Growatt actively holds the battery so solar bypasses to grid; SolaX still calls `set_solax_vpp_disabled()`, which lets solar passively recharge the battery during SOLAR_EXPORT), and (2) #413's LOAD_SUPPORT remote-control release (Growatt releases control to the inverter's own load-following self-use; SolaX still forces a fixed discharge-rate watt target). `SolaxController`'s own docstring (`solax_controller.py:120-126`) already flags the SOLAR_EXPORT gap as known and unverified on real hardware. These two controllers should probably converge on identical VPP semantics, but doing so changes real SolaX hardware behavior and needs its own hardware validation -- out of scope for the issue #415 display-only fix (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-control-model-display-design.md`), which instead surfaces this divergence transparently (each controller's displayed VPP power/remote-control state reflects its own actual, currently-different, behavior).

### Reconsider whether the all-IDLE numerical safety net is still needed

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: `dp_battery_algorithm.py`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-dp-bellman-guardrail-removal-design.md`

**Description**: After the "Bellman-optimality guardrail removal" refactor, `optimize_battery_schedule` still unconditionally computes a plain all-IDLE schedule and swaps it in if cheaper (`core/bess/dp_battery_algorithm.py:1514-1536`). Backward induction is optimal by construction — `IDLE` is always an available action at every period, so the DP's own schedule should never come out worse. The design doc's own investigation found this only guards a small residual (~0.16 SEK on one fixture, down from 0.27 SEK after an earlier partial fix) from SOE-grid discretization, "not provably zero without it." Worth revisiting whether finer discretization, the continuous-action reformulation mentioned as out-of-scope in that design doc, or another approach could close the residual gap fully, making this comparison genuinely removable rather than kept indefinitely as insurance.

### Move `charging_power_rate` out of `BatterySettings`

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: `power_monitor.py`, `settings_store.py`, migration

**Description**: `charging_power_rate` is stored in `BatterySettings` but it is not a battery hardware characteristic — it is a live Growatt number entity (`battery_charge_power_limit`) that is read and written via HA at runtime. It ended up in `BatterySettings` only because `power_monitor.py` needs an initial value before HA is read. That is weak justification for treating it as a user-facing battery setting.

**What needs to change**:

- Remove `charging_power_rate` from `BatterySettings` dataclass (`core/bess/settings.py`)
- Update `power_monitor.py` to use a local constant or read the initial value from HA directly
- Update schema migration in `settings_store.py` (remove from battery section, or move to growatt section)
- Verify `_BATTERY_MODEL_ATTRS` in `api.py` updates automatically (it is derived from the dataclass, so it will)
- Update any tests that reference `battery_settings.charging_power_rate`

### FormattingContext Architecture

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium-High (originally estimated 45 min — see below) | **Dependencies**: None

**Status**: Parked deliberately. **Do not start until the trigger below fires.**

**Description**: Replace currency parameter passing with FormattingContext dataclass for better extensibility and i18n support.

**Current State**: Currency passed as string parameter through call chain

**Implementation**: Create frozen FormattingContext dataclass, update `create_formatted_value()` and dataclass `from_internal()` methods, modify API endpoints to create context from settings

**Benefits**: Type safety, extensibility for locale/timezone/precision without signature changes, future-proof for internationalization

**Trigger — do it when a second field actually exists**: i.e. when locale,
timezone, or configurable precision is genuinely requested. Until then the
context would carry exactly one field (currency), so its shape has to be
guessed, and guessing wrong means doing the migration twice.

**Why not now** (measured 2026-08-05): the "45 min" estimate is wrong — there
are ~163 `create_formatted_value()` call sites across `backend/` and `core/`,
5 `from_internal()` implementations, and ~120 currency references in
`api_dataclasses.py` alone. Every one of them feeds a number the dashboard
renders, so the best possible outcome is that nothing changes visibly: pure
regression risk for no user-facing payoff, and nothing that would earn a
CHANGELOG line. When the trigger fires, the refactor pays for itself
immediately and the context's shape is dictated by a real requirement.

**Files**: `backend/api_dataclasses.py`, `backend/api.py`

### Upstream PR: growatt_server should register services per device type

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: HA core `homeassistant/components/growatt_server/services.py`

**Description**: The HA `growatt_server` integration unconditionally registers all 6 services (`update_time_segment`, `read_time_segments`, `write_ac_charge_times`, `read_ac_charge_times`, `write_ac_discharge_times`, `read_ac_discharge_times`) regardless of inverter type. At runtime the handlers check `device_type` and fail with "no devices configured" if the wrong type is called. This prevents external tools (like BESS) from using the service list to distinguish MIN from SPH.

**Proposed upstream fix**: Only register `update_time_segment`/`read_time_segments` when a MIN coordinator exists, and `write_ac_charge_times`/`read_ac_charge_times`/`write_ac_discharge_times`/`read_ac_discharge_times` when an SPH coordinator exists. This is a small change in `async_setup_services()`.

**After upstream fix lands**: Update our detection in `discover_ha_metadata()` to use services again (more robust than the current entity-registry `ac_charge` switch heuristic, which breaks if the user deletes the entity or if the HA integration changes entity creation).

**Current workaround**: We detect MIN vs SPH by checking if a `growatt_server` entity with unique_id ending in `-ac_charge` exists in the entity registry (MIN creates `switch.*_ac_charge`, SPH does not).

### Remove non-required derived sensors from discovery and config

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `ha_api_controller.py`, `sensorDefinitions.ts`

**Description**: Several sensors are discovered and stored in `bess_settings.json` but are never consumed — they are always derived from the 5 core energy sensors by `EnergyFlowCalculator`:

- `lifetime_system_production` (mapped from `total_yield`) — derived as `solar_production` when missing
- `lifetime_self_consumption` — derived as `load - import` when missing
- `lifetime_load_consumption` — derived as `solar + import - export` when missing

These sensors remain in the per-platform suffix maps (`GROWATT_MIN_SUFFIX_MAP`, `GROWATT_SPH_SUFFIX_MAP`, etc.), get discovered, appear in the wizard sensor list, and are saved to config, but nothing reads them at runtime. Remove them from the suffix maps and `sensorDefinitions.ts` to reduce wizard clutter and avoid confusion about which sensors actually matter.

**Files**: `core/bess/ha_api_controller.py` (per-platform suffix maps), `frontend/src/lib/sensorDefinitions.ts`

### Consolidate Growatt MIN/SPH detection into a single path

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low | **Dependencies**: `ha_api_controller.py`

**Description**: There are two separate heuristics for distinguishing Growatt MIN vs SPH:
1. `_parse_ha_metadata()` (line ~2163): binary check for `-tlx_` in any unique_id
2. `discover_sensors_from_registry()` (line ~2725): runs both suffix maps and picks the one with more matches

Both are called sequentially from `run_setup_discovery()` in `api.py`. They serve different stages (platform identification vs sensor mapping), but having two heuristics for the same question is fragile — they could theoretically disagree. Consolidate by deriving the platform list from the suffix map match results instead of the separate `has_tlx` check.

**Files**: `core/bess/ha_api_controller.py` (`_parse_ha_metadata`, `discover_sensors_from_registry`), `backend/api.py` (`run_setup_discovery`)

### Other Technical Debt

- Refactor all API endpoints to use dataclass-based serialization (with robust mapping for all field variants) for consistent, type-safe, and future-proof API responses. Ensure all details and fields are preserved as in the original dict-based implementation.

**From #221 (spot_multiplier/export_spot_multiplier) code review — deferred cleanup, not bugs**:

- `backend/api.py`'s `_pricing_defaults_for_discovery()` duplicates the provider-priority chain (`octopus > entsoe > nordpool_official > nordpool_hacs`, gated on `not nordpool_found`) already computed independently in `frontend/src/pages/SetupWizardPage.tsx`'s `autoProvider` logic. The two can drift out of sync if the priority order changes in only one place. Consider deriving both from a single shared source (e.g. have the backend return the resolved provider and have the frontend just consume it, instead of recomputing it).
- `backend/settings_store.py`'s `_migrate_schema()` electricity_price migration block hardcodes `spot_multiplier`/`export_spot_multiplier`/`use_actual_price` by name instead of iterating `PRICE_STORE_TO_API` + `PriceSettings` defaults generically. Every future `PriceSettings` field will need a new hand-written migration block, and it's easy to forget (silent `ValueError` in `build_system_settings()` at startup for existing users' configs). Consider making the migration generic against `PRICE_STORE_TO_API`.

**TOU Segment Matching is Fragile**:
The current TOU comparison uses exact matching on start_time, end_time, batt_mode. If a segment shifts by 15 minutes (e.g., 00:00-00:59 → 00:15-01:14), it's seen as completely different, resulting in 2 hardware writes (disable old + add new) instead of 1 update. Consider:

- Overlap-based matching: If segments overlap significantly and have same mode, treat as "same"
- Smart merging: Detect when segments can be extended/shortened rather than replaced

**Remove Hourly Aggregation Legacy** (mostly done — residual only):
The controller-side hourly aggregation is gone: `_calculate_hourly_settings_with_strategic_intents()`, `get_hourly_settings()`, `_get_hourly_intent()` and the `hourly_settings` dict no longer exist, and `adjust_charging_power()` reads `get_period_settings(current_period)` directly. What remains is display-side:

- `backend/api.py`'s `_get_hourly_settings_from_periods()` — a compatibility shim that majority-votes the 4 quarterly intents of an hour for API endpoints that still return hourly rows. Removable once the schedule display table renders 15-min periods.
- `get_strategic_intent_summary()` (`core/bess/inverter_controller.py`) still summarises per hour rather than per period.

**Re-run optimization on energy prediction method change**:
When the user changes the consumption strategy (e.g. from `sensor` to `fixed`), the optimization should re-run immediately with the new prediction method rather than waiting for the next scheduled cycle. The prediction cache should be cleared and a fresh optimization triggered in the same request that saves the new strategy.

## From #215 health-recovery-banner code review (non-blocking, low severity)

**Concurrent health-check race could double-record a recovery**:
`BatterySystemManager._run_health_check` reads `_cached_health_results` as `previous_results`, then later overwrites it and calls `_update_health_recoveries(previous_results, health_results)` — none of this is lock-protected. If the 5-minute cron job and a manual "Recheck now" click ever overlap almost exactly, both could read the same stale `previous_results` and each record a recovery for the same real transition, leaving a duplicate entry in the banner until acknowledged. Narrow timing window, not observed in practice; would need the tracker's own lock extended around the read-modify-write in `_run_health_check` to close it.

**Component disappearing from health checks leaves a stale pending recovery**:
`_update_health_recoveries` (core/bess/battery_system_manager.py) only visits components present in the *new* checks list. If a component goes ERROR then becomes unconfigured/absent (e.g. an optional check dropped by a settings change) before recovering, `clear_for_component` never runs for it and any stale pending recovery for that name lingers until acknowledged or evicted by the 50-entry cap. Edge case, low impact.

**`/api/health-recoveries` uses camelCase (`convert_keys_to_camel_case`) while sibling `/api/runtime-failures` returns raw snake_case `__dict__`**:
Both are valid given each has its own matching frontend hook, but it's an inconsistent precedent for the next tracker-style endpoint someone adds. Worth standardizing next time either is touched.

## From #317 period-group intent reconciliation code review (non-blocking)

**`backend/api.py`'s new `today_reconciled_intents` build has two silent fallbacks** (`planned_intent` defaults to `"IDLE"` when `period_idx >= len(planned_intents)`, and out-of-range periods also append `planned_intent`) that follow the existing `INTENT_TO_MODE.get(intent, "load_first")` convention in `inverter_controller.py`, but technically fall under `docs/agents/rules.md`'s "Explicit failure over silent degradation" rule. Low risk since it's a display-only path, not a control path, and the pattern is already pervasive in this file — not filed as a blocker.

**Behavior change on cold start**: previously, if `schedule_manager.strategic_intents` was empty (e.g. right after startup, before the controller applies a schedule) but `schedule_store.get_latest_schedule()` already had a stored schedule, `get_detailed_period_groups()` returned `[]` outright (its `if not effective_intents: return []` early exit). Now the endpoint always builds a full per-period `today_reconciled_intents` list (defaulting missing planned entries to `"IDLE"`), so period_groups will render partial data (actual periods reconciled, future periods shown as `"IDLE"`) in that window instead of nothing. This looks like an improvement in line with the issue's intent (show what's real, not what's stale) but is a user-visible behavior change worth knowing about if it's ever reported as "showing IDLE for periods with no plan yet."

**Files**: `backend/api.py` (`get_growatt_detailed_schedule`, ~lines 1719-1758)

## From #353 immediate_value/future_value investigation (non-blocking)

**`DecisionData.immediate_value` duplicates the live `EconomicData.grid_cost`/dashboard "Net Grid Cost" metric and should probably be removed.** Traced while building the debug-log visualization skill: `immediate_value = export_revenue - import_cost - battery_wear_cost` (`decision_intelligence.py:413`) is exactly `-(grid_cost + battery_wear_cost)`, where `grid_cost = import_cost - export_revenue` (`core/bess/models.py:232`) is the same figure already surfaced live as `netGridCost` (`backend/api.py:776-782` → `SystemStatusCard.tsx`'s headline tile). The only difference is a sign flip and whether wear cost is netted in — and neither `immediate_value` nor `future_value` (nor the `economic_chain` narrative string, nor `/api/decision-intelligence`) is reachable anywhere in the live app: `frontend/src/components/DecisionFramework.tsx`, the only consumer that renders any of these fields, is never imported by any routed page in `App.tsx` — it's orphaned/dead code. `future_value` (fixed in #353 to no longer be always `0.0`) doesn't have this exact duplication problem — there's no live "value-to-go" KPI to compare against — but it's equally unreachable today.

**Superseded**: the design decision this note was waiting on has been made — see
"Scrap the Decision Intelligence framework" under TECHNICAL DEBT, which deletes
the whole path (`immediate_value` included) rather than wiring it up.

---

## From #387 runtime power gap-fill code review (non-blocking)

**`backend/app.py` constructs `BESSController()` and calls `start_in_background()` at module level**, which is what forces `backend/tests/test_scheduler_jobs.py` to patch two unrelated methods (`SettingsStore._write`, `HomeAssistantAPIController.get_ha_config`) just to import the module safely for testing.

**Do not "fix" this with `if __name__ == "__main__":`** — every launch path is `uvicorn app:app` (`backend/run.sh`, `backend/Dockerfile.dev`, `docker-compose.ci.yml`, `docker-compose.prod-test.yml`), so `__name__` is always `"app"` and the guarded block would never run. That would silently stop BESS from ever starting while leaving the web server up.

The real fix is to move construction into the FastAPI `lifespan` startup hook, which runs under uvicorn but not on bare import. That is a change to the application's entire startup path (and `api.py`'s `from app import bess_controller` would then see `None` until lifespan runs), so it needs the mock-HA E2E stack to verify — not a small cleanup.
