"""Record each pinned scenario's production terminal value into its fixture.

Every scenario in `core/bess/tests/unit/data/` used to fall through to
`optimize_battery_schedule`'s `terminal_value_per_kwh=0.0` default, so the
branch that builds the DP's terminal row never executed and `V[horizon]` stayed
all zeros. The entire pinned corpus was therefore blind to the terminal value in
both directions -- it could neither regress nor validate it (TODO.md, found
while investigating #345).

This script closes that by computing each fixture's terminal value the way
production does -- `core/bess/terminal_value.py` applied to that fixture's own
prices -- and writing it into the fixture as an explicit
`terminal_value_per_kwh` key. Explicit rather than inferred at load time, for
the same reason `export_curtailment_active` is recorded explicitly: a reader of
the fixture can see what the scenario runs at, and the value replays
identically even if the helper changes.

Cap scoping (#422): production scopes the arbitrage-consistency cap to sell
prices on the terminal boundary's own calendar day. Fixtures carry no
timestamps, so the equivalent window here is the last `24 / period_duration`
periods -- verified to reproduce `regression_frank_debug_before`'s
independently-pinned 0.143013413 exactly, where the unscoped array gives
0.195488259 (the pre-#422 value). `buy_prices` stays the full remaining horizon,
matching production.

Re-running is safe and idempotent. Because a terminal value changes what the DP
plans, re-running invalidates the pinned economics: regenerate in this order.

    --check  exit non-zero if any fixture's recorded value is missing or stale,
             without writing. Intended for local verification, not CI.
