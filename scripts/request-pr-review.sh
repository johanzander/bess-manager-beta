# Trigger the Stage 4 `@claude-bot` PR review and block until its verdict lands.
#
# Used by the `implement-issue` review loop (Step 11). It exists as a script,
# not inline in the skill, so the whole wait costs zero tokens: run it with
# run_in_background and you are notified once when it exits, instead of an
# agent re-reading the session context every poll.
#
# The trigger comment is posted as `bess-agent` (automation identity, per
# scripts/gh-agent.sh). pr-review.yml's gate accepts that login alongside the
# repo owner.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/request-pr-review.sh <pr-number> [timeout-seconds]
#
# Output (stdout, last line):
#   VERDICT <APPROVED|CHANGES_REQUESTED|COMMENTED> <submittedAt-iso> <author>
#
# The author is reported rather than filtered on: any review newer than the
# trigger is a real signal, including one the maintainer submits by hand while
# the bot is still thinking. The caller decides what to do with it.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  a new review landed; verdict on stdout
#   2  timed out waiting (recent PR Review runs dumped for diagnosis)
#   1  usage/precondition error
