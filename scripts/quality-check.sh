# Replaces the hook-matrix gate deleted with the hooks (#588). verify-sandbox.sh
# cannot fill that role -- it exits 2 unless the Bash tool runs it in a
# sandboxed session, so it can never be a CI or pre-commit check. What IS
# statically checkable is that the rules which stand in for the deleted hooks
# are still present. Every entry below was a real regression at some point:
# option-first `git stash` forms fell through to `auto` because the deny list
# enumerated literal subcommands, and the GitHub-publishing guards were dropped
# entirely -- effects the sandbox cannot contain, since it bounds the
# filesystem, not the network.
# `if ! ...` is load-bearing: `set -e` (line 6) aborts the whole script on a
# bare failing statement, so a plain heredoc here would skip the ERRORS
# increment, the checks below it, AND the final summary -- a missing rule would
# stop the run mid-file with no verdict, which is the opposite of a gate.
if ! python3 - <<'PY'
import json, re, sys

# Patterns match the command AS WRITTEN -- prefix globbing, no normalisation.
# `gh api` is guarded by a BLANKET rule on purpose: the dangerous shapes put
# their marker at an arbitrary argument position (`gh api <path> -X PUT`,
# `gh api <path> -f k=v`), which a prefix glob cannot reach. Enumerating them
# left real holes twice. Narrowing it back to specific forms re-opens the
# holes, so the check requires the blanket spelling rather than merely "some
# rule exists".
#
# `git push` USED to be in that same sentence and no longer is. It was never
# the glob that made it safe -- the glob was a blunt instrument compensating
# for having no guard at the only layer that can actually see a ref update.
# The four leaks it was blanket-guarding against are now refused SERVER-SIDE
# by GitHub rulesets, which evaluate the resulting ref rather than the command
# string, so argument order cannot evade them:
#
#   git push origin main --force        -> non_fast_forward on ~DEFAULT_BRANCH
#   git push origin +beta-release-9.9   -> non_fast_forward on beta-release-*
#   git push origin --delete <ref>      -> deletion on both of the above
#   git push origin v9.9.0 (force/move) -> non_fast_forward on ~ALL tags
#
# All rulesets are enforcement=active with an EMPTY bypass_actors list, so
# they bind the repo owner too -- which matters, because local pushes
# authenticate as the owner (osxkeychain), never as bess-agent.
#
# Do NOT re-add a `Bash(git push*)` ask on the grounds that "a guard is
# missing". Check the rulesets first:
#
#   gh api repos/johanzander/bess-manager/rulesets
#   gh api repos/johanzander/bess-manager-beta/rulesets
#
# What this deliberately does NOT cover: force-pushing or deleting a FEATURE
# branch (fix/**, feat/**) on origin, nor `release-X.Y` (see MUST_NOT_BE_GUARDED
# below). Accepted residuals -- but NOT because "the damage is bounded to your
# own unmerged branch". ~20 worktrees push in parallel as the same identity, so
# a misaimed --force destroys another agent's commits and closes its PR, with
# the recovering reflog sitting in a different worktree.
#
# Every entry below is a rule whose deletion is the exact regression this gate
# was written for -- the GitHub-reaching and history-destroying guards. Keep
# this list in sync with the ask/deny lists; a rule absent from here is a rule
# that can be silently removed.

# NOT modelled here, deliberately:
#
# * COMPOUND COMMANDS. `cd frontend && git push origin main` matches nothing in
#   this matcher, because matches() emulates a single command string. The
#   harness decomposes on &&/;/| before applying rules, so the real decision is
#   made on `git push origin main` -- do not "fix" this by adding compound
#   entries here; they would fail against a matcher that is correct for what it
#   models. Verifying the decomposition claim needs a live permission test, not
#   this gate.
# * GREEDY GLOBS. `*` compiles to `.*`, which spans spaces, so `git -* push*`
#   also matches e.g. a commit whose MESSAGE contains " push". That is a false
#   PROMPT, not a hole, and it is accepted: the alternative is dropping the
#   global-option guard on push, which is a real bypass. Precision here is
#   bounded by prefix globbing -- when the choice is between an extra prompt
#   and a gap, take the prompt.

# Read-only git must NOT be caught: an autonomous run executing rules.md's
# cross-checkout procedure (`git diff -- f | git -C <wt> apply`, then
# `git -C <wt> diff -- f` to verify) would otherwise stall on inspection
# commands. A blanket `Bash(git -*)` did exactly that, which is why the
