# One gh pr diff per open PR, bounded by the WIP limit in practice. The

# Merged PRs are needed to tell a LIVE worktree from a DEAD one. Without this,

# and #542 all reported In Progress while their PRs (#610, #618, #591) had
# already merged, because the worktree was never pruned. `--state merged` is
# the only authoritative signal here — this repo squash-merges, so a merged
# branch is never an ancestor of main and `git branch --merged` reports
# nothing as merged.
#
# The bodies are REDUCED to the issue numbers they reference before being passed

# several KB each. Only the closing references and the branch name are needed to
# decide whether a merged PR belongs to an issue, so extract those here and hand
# jq a few hundred bytes instead of a megabyte.
# Inline-code spans carry EXAMPLES, never linkage declarations, so a `#N`
# inside backticks must not associate a PR with an issue. Defined once, here,
# because BOTH linkage scans need it and they are separate jq programs -- the
# merged-PR scan immediately below, and `linkage_body` in the digest program
# further down. Fixing only one of them is how PR #684 shipped: it stripped
# code spans in the merged scan while its own body, quoting

# `claude agents` lists BACKGROUND agents only, and this is the trap that made
# the rhythm pass tell the maintainer to restart work that was actively
# running. Two independent reasons it cannot answer "is someone on this":
#
#   1. A session started in the terminal — `claude` in a CLI, then
#      `/implement-issue <n>` — is a foreground session and never appears here
#      at all. That is how #624 was dispatched.
#   2. Even a background agent carries a generated descriptive name ("Review PR
#      and create branch for bess-manager"), not the `issue-<n>` the dispatch
#      convention promises, so the exact-name match below misses it too.
#
# Measured: 41 worktrees on disk, `claude agents --json` returning ONE entry.
# So `session` was null for essentially every item, every worktree read as
# abandoned, and `resume_implementation` fired on live sessions — against work
# whose branch commits the skill itself calls the only copy.
#
# The worktree LOCK is the signal that actually tracks a live session: 4 of
# those 41 were locked, and they were exactly the four live sessions. It is
# local, needs no process list, and covers foreground and background alike.
# `session` is kept because a name match is strictly more informative when it
# does happen; it is no longer what liveness rests on.
sessions=$(claude agents --json)

# No `--field "Priority"` here: verified against the real CLI just now,
# `gh project item-list --field "Priority" --format json` is rejected
# outright with "cannot use --format with --field or --field-id" —
# `--field` only adds extra columns to the human-readable table, it is not
# a JSON-output selector. `--format json` alone was confirmed to reach the
# API (tested against a nonexistent project number: it returns a GraphQL
# "could not resolve" error, not a flag error), so JSON output is assumed to
# already include custom field values without needing `--field` at all.
# --limit matches the 200 used for `gh issue list` above; the item-list

  # "unblocks #485", "unrelated to #402" -- and linking on them would flip an

  # DRAFT IS NOT IN REVIEW (#707). An open PR only means In Review once it is
  # out of draft -- the review loop has actually started. A draft PR is In
  # Progress: the branch and PR exist, nothing is reviewing them yet. This is
  # what lets #162 (draft PR, parked for the reporter) read as In Progress, and
  # as Analysis once an `Awaiting` is set on it.
  #
  # ORDER IS THE CONTENT. Active work outranks landed work: In Progress (a live
  # worktree or an open draft PR) is checked before In Verification, so an
  # issue with a merged intermediate PR AND an active follow-up branch reads
  # as In Progress, not as verified. A stray merged-and-done issue with a rot
  # worktree does not hit this -- scratch worktrees are excluded by
  # `matches_issue` and a genuinely merged branch is caught by
  # `worktree_is_stale`, so `$wt_live` is already false for both (#602).
