# One gh pr diff per open PR, bounded by the WIP limit in practice. The

# instead of guessing.
#
# No `2>/dev/null || true` here: a PR whose diff cannot be read is NOT the

# triage and dispatch over a single stale PR. Neither extreme is acceptable:
# the failure is recorded as DATA in `undiffable_prs` instead, and the loop
# continues over the remaining PRs. The collision gate (backlog-rhythm.sh)

# `claude agents` lists BACKGROUND agents only, and this is the trap that made
# the rhythm pass tell the maintainer to restart work that was actively
# running. Two independent reasons it cannot answer "is someone on this":
#
#   1. A session started in the terminal — `claude` in a CLI, then
#      `/implement-issue <n>` — is a foreground session and never appears here
#      at all. That is how #624 was dispatched.
#   2. Even a background agent carries a generated descriptive name ("Review PR
#      and create branch for bess-manager"), not the `issue-<n>` the dispatch
#      convention promises, so the exact-name match below misses it too.
#
# Measured: 41 worktrees on disk, `claude agents --json` returning ONE entry.
# So `session` was null for essentially every item, every worktree read as
# abandoned, and `resume_implementation` fired on live sessions — against work
# whose branch commits the skill itself calls the only copy.
#
# The worktree LOCK is the signal that actually tracks a live session: 4 of
# those 41 were locked, and they were exactly the four live sessions. It is
# local, needs no process list, and covers foreground and background alike.
# `session` is kept because a name match is strictly more informative when it
# does happen; it is no longer what liveness rests on.
sessions=$(claude agents --json)

# No `--field "Priority"` here: verified against the real CLI just now,
# `gh project item-list --field "Priority" --format json` is rejected
# outright with "cannot use --format with --field or --field-id" —
# `--field` only adds extra columns to the human-readable table, it is not
# a JSON-output selector. `--format json` alone was confirmed to reach the
# API (tested against a nonexistent project number: it returns a GraphQL
# "could not resolve" error, not a flag error), so JSON output is assumed to
# already include custom field values without needing `--field` at all.
# --limit matches the 200 used for `gh issue list` above; the item-list
# default is 30, which would silently truncate against this repo's 37+ open
# issues.
#
# NOTE: the board does not exist yet (created by a deferred task), so the
# exact JSON key the Priority field lands under is still unverified. The jq
# below assumes it arrives as a top-level `.priority` on each item (matching
# the existing `$board.items[]?.priority?` lookup). Confirm this against a
# real board the first time one exists, and fix the jq path below if the

    # The board holds issues, and every judgement about a PR therefore had
    # nowhere to live. "#437 is lower priority, I will get to it later" and
    # "#167 and #354 are blocked" are real decisions, and the rhythm pass
    # re-reported all three as due on every tick because nothing recorded them
    # — so the same conversation happened every 30 minutes.

    # Projects v2 takes PRs as items with the identical field set, so the fix
    # is membership rather than a parallel mechanism: a PR card carries the
    # same `Priority` and `Awaiting` an issue card does, and `backlog-rhythm.sh`
    # suppresses on them.
    #
    # `content.type` is what separates the two, confirmed against a real card
    # rather than assumed: an added PR reports `"type": "PullRequest"` with
    # `number`, `title`, `url` and `repository` alongside it. Numbers are unique
    # across issues and PRs in one repository, so this cannot collide with the
    # issue lookup above.
    #
    # Emitted as a lookup rather than merged into a PR list, because the digest
    # does not own the open-PR list — `backlog-rhythm.sh` fetches that with the
    # review fields it needs, and joins this in by number.
