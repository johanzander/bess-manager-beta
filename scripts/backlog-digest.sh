# No `--field "Priority"` here: verified against the real CLI just now,
# `gh project item-list --field "Priority" --format json` is rejected
# outright with "cannot use --format with --field or --field-id" —
# `--field` only adds extra columns to the human-readable table, it is not
# a JSON-output selector. `--format json` alone was confirmed to reach the
# API (tested against a nonexistent project number: it returns a GraphQL
# "could not resolve" error, not a flag error), so JSON output is assumed to
# already include custom field values without needing `--field` at all.
# --limit matches the 200 used for `gh issue list` above; the item-list
# default is 30, which would silently truncate against this repo's 37+ open
# issues.
#
# NOTE: the board does not exist yet (created by a deferred task), so the
# exact JSON key the Priority field lands under is still unverified. The jq
# below assumes it arrives as a top-level `.priority` on each item (matching
# the existing `$board.items[]?.priority?` lookup). Confirm this against a
# real board the first time one exists, and fix the jq path below if the
# assumption is wrong — do not add a fallback that tries multiple shapes.
