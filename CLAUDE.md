# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
this repository. Read `docs/agents/rules.md` first — those constraints are
non-negotiable and apply to all agents.

## Verification Before Action

- ALWAYS run tests locally before pushing commits — never push to any remote until local tests are green
- ALWAYS verify against actual source code/repos before making assumptions about APIs, entity names, or naming patterns
- NEVER speculate about file contents or behavior - read the file or run the code first
- Before proposing any fix, show the exact code path and evidence (logs, source) that proves the root cause — do not guess at entity names, prefixes, or discovery logic

## Issue Work

- Any request to fix, resolve, or implement a GitHub issue (e.g. "fix #123",
  "resolve this issue") MUST go through the `implement-issue` skill from the
  start — not ad-hoc brainstorming, writing-plans, or direct edits. It already
  encodes PR hygiene rules (e.g. don't commit plan files) that get skipped
  otherwise.

## Project Overview

BESS Manager is a Home Assistant add-on for optimizing battery energy storage
systems. It provides price-based optimization, solar integration, and a web
interface for managing battery schedules and monitoring energy flows.

## Architecture in One Paragraph

FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) runs an hourly scheduler. The core
optimization engine (`core/bess/`) uses dynamic programming to generate a
24-hour battery schedule from electricity spot prices and real-time sensor
data. The schedule is sent to a Growatt inverter via the Home Assistant API.
A React SPA (`frontend/`) provides the management interface.

## Automated Agent Workflow

GitHub issues flow through a four-stage pipeline. Each stage is a separate
workflow file with a self-contained prompt — there is no cross-stage routing
through CLAUDE.md. All stages run on `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`.

| Stage | Trigger | Workflow | Cost | What it does |
|-------|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| 1. Triage | `issues: opened/edited` (auto) | `issue-triage.yml` | ~$0.05 | Classify + label only. Gates on debug log presence. |
| 2. Analyze | `@claude-bot analyze` (manual) | `issue-analyze.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Delegates to `bess-analyst` sub-agent, posts root-cause diagnosis. No code changes. |
| 3. Fix | `@claude-bot fix` (manual) | `issue-fix.yml` | ~$1–4 | Runs the `implement-issue` skill in CI mode per the Stage 2 plan, opens draft PR. |
| 4. Review | `@claude-bot` on a PR (manual) | `pr-review.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Reviews diff against rules and checklist. |
| 5. Integrate | `@claude-bot integrate` (manual) | `issue-integrate.yml` | ~$2–10 | Drives a new inverter/provider request through the full experimental→stable lifecycle (`feature-lifecycle`), one stage per invocation. |

**Why gated, not auto:** Stages 2 and 3 cost real money. The user explicitly
triggers each one after reading the previous stage's output.

**Label flow:**

```
opened ──► bug + needs-debug-log     (Stage 1: no log)
            │
            └─ user adds log ──► bug + ready-for-analysis  (Stage 1 re-runs on edit)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot analyze
                                  ▼
                                  analyzed                 (Stage 2)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot fix
                                  ▼
                                  has-fix-pr               (Stage 3, draft PR open)
```

If Stage 2 can't reach a conclusion it applies `needs-human-review` instead
of `analyzed`.

### General bot rules

- Only the repo owner can trigger bot commands. The one exception is Stage 4:
  `pr-review.yml` also accepts `@claude-bot` from the developer automation
  identity (currently the `bess-agent` GitHub account; being renamed to
  `bess-developer` — see `scripts/gh-agent.sh`), so `implement-issue`'s
  Step 11 loop can request its own review. `bess-developer` is added to that
  gate only in the same commit that renames the account — never before,
  since pre-authorising an unregistered username on a public repo is
  exploitable. Stages 1–3 and 5 stay owner-only — those spend money on work
  nobody has asked for yet.
- Automation writes carry a **role** identity, and role is the axis:
  `bess-product-owner` (intake, backlog, board, reporter comments),
  `bess-developer` (analyze, fix, PR authorship, requesting review),
  `bess-reviewer` (Stage 4 review only). Developer and Reviewer are
  deliberately distinct — Stage 4 reviews Stage 3's own output, and one shared
  face would read as an account approving its own PR. Post via
  `scripts/gh-agent.sh --as po|dev`. Genuine maintainer voice still uses plain
  `gh`.
- Always use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, labels).
- Never push directly to `main`. PRs are always *opened* as drafts, and no
  agent ever merges one — the merge is the maintainer's, always.
- **Who takes a PR out of draft depends on which flow opened it.** An
  interactive `implement-issue` run drives its own review loop, so its
  Step 11 marks the PR ready (`gh pr ready`) the moment Stage 4 returns
  `APPROVED`, leaving only the merge. A **Stage 3 (`issue-fix.yml`) PR stays
  a draft even after Stage 4 approves it** — CI mode skips Step 11, so
  nothing there runs `gh pr ready`, and you are triggering that review by
  hand anyway. Flip it yourself when you're satisfied.
- The bot identity is `bess-manager-claude-bot` (a custom GitHub App). The
  official Anthropic Claude App is **suspended** to avoid collisions —
  do not unsuspend it.
- Stage 2 must invoke the `bess-analyst` sub-agent. Skipping that step is
  the failure mode the previous design suffered from.

## Release Workflow

- Always release through a PR so CI runs — never push directly to a branch bypassing CI
- Always check the current published version before tagging (e.g., check GitHub releases) to avoid version collisions
- Confirm the target remote and branch BEFORE pushing releases (beta vs main, origin vs beta remote)
- Run the full test suite locally before any release tag or beta push
- Never skip the CHANGELOG.md update or version bump
- `beta/main` only ever advances by fast-forward from `origin/main` — never commit directly to the beta repo. If a fix is needed on the currently-published stable version while main has moved on, use the hotfix procedure (short-lived `release-X.Y` branch cherry-picking from main), never a direct beta commit.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is authored once, on `origin/main`, under `## [Unreleased]`. Beta and stable releases both consume that section (copy for beta, rename for stable) — never hand-write a beta-specific or duplicate changelog entry.

## Scope Discipline

- Do NOT modify, remove, or 'clean up' items the user hasn't asked you to change
- When doing cleanup, list what you plan to change and confirm before editing
- Do not revert intentional linter changes or simplifications without explicit instruction
- After editing, list every file and symbol changed so the user can confirm nothing unrelated was touched
- Never add speculative fallbacks, defensive error handling, or "robustness" improvements beyond what was asked
- Never add a parameter, flag, default-fallback, second construction site, or extra trigger whose only job is to route around an ordering/timing/dependency problem — fix that problem directly (reorder, or reuse/expose what already exists); see `docs/agents/rules.md` Debugging Protocol step 8

## Cost Discipline

The user pays per token. A long Opus session that re-reads a large context after
every multi-minute wait is what runs up the bill — not the work itself.

- **Pick the best-fit model per task.** No model is pinned in
  `.claude/settings.json`, so sessions start on the Claude Code default.
  Reach for a stronger model on genuinely hard reasoning, and prefer a
  cheaper one for routine coordination, iteration, CI-watching, or file edits.
- **Don't put subagents on an expensive model**, and avoid agents for
  long-running watches entirely; if delegation is truly needed, use a cheap model.
- **Don't hold one big session across many long CI/test waits.** The prompt
  cache expires after ~5 min, so each long wait forces a full uncached re-read
  of the entire context. Prefer `/clear` between unrelated chunks, or let the
  session sit idle rather than re-engaging every few minutes.
- Don't re-dump large files or logs into context.
- **Treat `implement-issue` Step 8 (`verify`, podman-compose/mock-HA E2E) as
  a session boundary.** Kick it off, then either let the session sit idle
  until it completes or `/clear` and resume fresh once it's done — don't
  stay engaged re-touching the diagnosis/TDD context through the wait.

## Worktree Conventions

Both layouts are first-class — either way the worktree is a normal git checkout,
so per-agent inspect / test / run (`./deploy.sh`, `pytest`, the app) works the
same. Choose by how you want to reach an agent's work:

- **Sibling folders** (e.g. `../bess-manager-feature/`) — open cleanly in their
  own VS Code window; this is the go-to when you actively inspect code and run
  scripts per agent. They work with Agent View too: start the background session
  *inside* the sibling (it's a linked git worktree, so Claude won't relocate it).
  Caveat: a sibling only appears in **unscoped** `claude agents` (or
  `--cwd ~/GitHub`), not in the project-scoped `claude agents --cwd <repo>` view.
- **Native `.claude/worktrees/`** (`claude agents` / `--worktree` /
  `EnterWorktree`) — auto-created for background sessions and visible in the
  **project-scoped** Agent View. Still a real checkout: `code
  <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` or `cd` into it to run tests/scripts.

Find any session's worktree path by peeking/attaching it in Agent View, or via
`claude agents --json` (the `cwd` field).

**Run `./scripts/worktree-setup.sh` once in every new worktree, before any
test/build/verify step.** A fresh worktree has no `.venv` and no
`node_modules`, and reinstalling them costs ~35 minutes against ~5 minutes of
actual testing. The script shares all three dependency trees with the main
checkout (falling back to a real `npm install` only for a package root whose
lockfile actually diverged) and repairs a Playwright browser cache left
unusable by an interrupted install.

Those shared trees are symlinks, so they are read-shared but **not**
write-isolated: `npm install` or `pip install` inside a worktree writes through
the link and changes dependencies for the main checkout and every other
worktree at once. Running tests and builds is safe; when a branch needs its own
dependency set, replace the symlink with a real install (`rm .venv` / `rm
frontend/node_modules` first) rather than installing through it. Re-running
`worktree-setup.sh` handles the node case automatically once
`package-lock.json` diverges — `requirements.txt` drift is not detected.

### Permissions

**An agent should run end-to-end without approving anything that the sandbox
already contains.** Prompts are the cost, not the safety: a stalled autonomous
run is a guaranteed loss, while anything the sandbox bounds is recoverable.
`rm`, `git reset --hard`, `rebase`, `merge`, `git branch -D`, `git worktree
remove` all run unattended. **`git push` also runs unattended, in every
spelling including `--force`** — not because pushing is safe, but because the
refs worth protecting are protected on GitHub itself. See "Pushing is guarded
server-side" below.

What still asks is one closed list, and every entry is there because the
**sandbox cannot contain it** — it bounds the filesystem, not the network, and
not `.git`'s own recovery data:

| Category | Rules |
|---|---|
| Escapes to GitHub | **every `gh api`**, `gh pr merge`, `gh release create` / `edit` / `delete` / `delete-asset` / `upload`, `gh repo edit`, `gh secret`, `gh workflow run` |
| Destroys the recovery mechanism | `git gc`, `git prune`, `git repack`, `git maintenance`, `git reflog expire`, `git reflog delete`, `git update-ref`, `git tag -d` / `--delete` / `-f` |
| Leaves the user boundary | `sudo` |

Each of those also has a `git -* <verb>` twin covering the global-option
spelling (`git -C <path> gc`, `git -C sub tag -d`). The twins name a **verb**
on purpose: a blanket `Bash(git -*)` was tried and put read-only inspection —
`git -C sub status`, `git -C <wt> diff`, the verify step of the cross-checkout
patch recipe — behind a prompt, and it shadowed the `git commit` allow via
`git -c user.email=… commit`.

**`*` compiles to a greedy `.*` that spans spaces**, which bounds how precise
any of this can be. `git -* tag -d*` therefore also matches a `git -c … commit`
whose *message* contains " tag -d". That is an extra prompt, not a gap, and it
is accepted — the alternative is dropping the global-option guard on tag
deletion, which is a real bypass. When the choice is between a false prompt and
a hole, take the prompt. The one case where that trade flips is `deny`, which has no
override: an over-broad deny **blocks** documented work rather than prompting
for it, which is why `git prune` has no twin (it caught `git worktree prune`,
and Step 4 prunes in a loop) and why the stash twins are per-verb.

Denied outright: the shared podman VM (`machine rm`, `system reset`) and every
mutating `git stash` form, **including `git -C <path> stash …`**. That last
clause is load-bearing rather than decorative: the global-option spelling was
briefly covered only by an `ask`, and since `deny > ask` applies by category, a
matching `ask` with no matching `deny` turns a prohibition into a prompt. The
gate checks stash and podman shapes against `deny` **only** for that reason.

The standard for adding an entry: **the effect escapes the repo and git cannot
undo it.** Not "the command looks dangerous". Both halves have to hold, which
is why **`gh pr ready` is deliberately unattended** even though it plainly
escapes to GitHub: `gh pr ready --undo` puts the PR straight back, it changes
no content (the diff was already public, pushed by Step 9), and it is the
codified endpoint of `implement-issue` Step 11's
review loop. Prompting there would stall the one flow whose entire point is to
reach that state without you. Contrast `gh pr merge` one row up, which is the
same category and *is* gated: nothing undoes a merge to `main`.

**`gh release` names its verbs for the same reason.** The standard is "the
effect escapes the repo *and* git cannot undo it" — `gh release list` and `gh
release view` fail the first half outright, since reading changes nothing on
GitHub. A blanket `gh release*` therefore prompted on the exact command the
release rule above *requires* ("always check the current published version
before tagging"), and on every beta/stable version comparison. `create`,
`edit`, `delete`, `delete-asset` and `upload` still ask; `list`, `view` and
`download` run unattended, and `quality-check.sh` pins both halves so the
split cannot collapse back into either a blanket rule or a hole.

The second category exists
because leaving `rm` and `reset --hard` unattended is only defensible while the
object database and reflog can recover them — a `gc --prune=now` that ran
unprompted would remove the ground that argument stands on.

**`gh api` is guarded bluntly, and that is deliberate.** It was enumerated by
shape first, and it leaked:

```
gh api repos/o/r/pulls/N/merge -X PUT # merges, bypassing `gh pr merge`
gh api <path> -f key=val              # any -f/-F makes it a POST
```

The marker sits at an arbitrary argument position, and **prefix globbing cannot
reach it.** Narrowing it back to specific forms re-opens both lines, so
`quality-check.sh` requires the blanket spelling rather than merely "some `gh
api` rule exists".

### Pushing is guarded server-side, not by a prompt

`git push` used to be in that same paragraph, blanket-guarded against four
spellings that a prefix glob could not reach:

```
git push origin main --force          # --force not adjacent to `push`
git push origin +beta-release-9.9     # force via refspec
git push origin --delete release-X.Y  # destroys a shared ref
git push origin v9.9.0                # moves a published release tag
```

The glob was never what made those safe — it was a blunt instrument
compensating for having no guard at the only layer that can see a *ref update*
rather than a command string. That layer now exists. Four **GitHub rulesets**,
all `enforcement=active` with an **empty `bypass_actors` list**, refuse three
of the four lines above — see the gap called out immediately after the table:

| Repo | Ruleset | Applies to | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bess-manager` | Protect Main Branch | `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` | deletion, non_fast_forward, pull_request |
| `bess-manager` | Protect beta release branches | `beta-release-*` | deletion, non_fast_forward |
| `bess-manager` | Protect release tags | `~ALL` tags | deletion, non_fast_forward |
| `bess-manager-beta` | Protect beta main (fast-forward only) | `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` | deletion, non_fast_forward |

⚠️ **`release-X.Y` is not in that table, and `--delete release-X.Y` is
therefore unguarded at BOTH layers.** That is the one line of the four above
which nothing currently refuses. It is the short-lived stable hotfix branch the
`release` skill creates (steps 2–6), and it *is* pushed and tagged, so it is a
shared ref by the standard used everywhere else here. The protected tag
preserves the released commit, which makes the branch recoverable after
tagging but not before.

Left open knowingly rather than by oversight — closing it means adding a
`release-*` ruleset (`non_fast_forward`, and deliberately **not** `deletion`,
since the branch is meant to be cleaned up after the release). Do **not** close
it by restoring a `Bash(git push*)` ask: that guards every push to fix one
branch pattern, and `quality-check.sh` fails on it.

The empty bypass list is the load-bearing part: **local pushes authenticate as
the repo owner**, not as `bess-agent` (the credential helper is osxkeychain and
`gh auth status` reports `johanzander`). A ruleset that exempted admins would
therefore exempt every push this machine makes and protect nothing.

Read the current state before trusting this table — it is a snapshot of remote
config, not of anything in this repo:

```bash
gh api repos/johanzander/bess-manager/rulesets
gh api repos/johanzander/bess-manager-beta/rulesets
```

**Two consequences to know about.**

*Tag creation is still allowed*, only deletion and force-update are blocked —
otherwise `release` could not tag at all. The flip side: removing a tag pushed
by mistake now requires editing the ruleset, deliberately, as the owner. That
is the intended trade.

*The pending beta GHCR migration force-pushes `main` to `beta/main`*, which
`Protect beta main` now refuses. That is a one-time deliberate operation:
set that ruleset to `enforcement: "disabled"`, push, set it back to `"active"`.
Do not add a bypass actor for it — a standing exemption for the identity that
does every push is the same hole as having no rule.

**What this deliberately leaves open:** force-pushing or deleting a *feature*
branch (`fix/**`, `feat/**`) on origin, so ordinary work needs no prompt.

**Do not describe that residual as "bounded to your own unmerged branch."** It
was written that way first and the reasoning does not survive this repo's own
conventions: ~20 worktrees run in parallel, each with its own pushed branch and
open PR, and every one of them authenticates as the same owner. An unattended
`--force` or `--delete` aimed at the wrong ref destroys *another agent's*
pushed commits and closes its PR, and the local reflog that would recover it
lives in a different worktree. The bound is "one feature branch", not "one
agent's own work".

Accepted anyway, because the alternative — a `fix/**` + `feat/**`
`non_fast_forward` ruleset — also blocks the legitimate rebase-and-force-push
on your own branch, and this project's merge-based flow means a force push
appearing at all is the finding (see below). Know which trade is being made.

**Do not re-add a `Bash(git push*)` ask because pushing "looks unguarded".**
`quality-check.sh` pins the new direction: the push spellings live in
`MUST_NOT_BE_GUARDED`, so restoring the prompt fails the gate. Check the
rulesets first.

**Patterns match the command as written — prefix globbing, no normalisation.**
This is the single biggest source of rules that look right and match nothing,
and it produced a bug here in four consecutive review rounds.

**Nothing normalises `git`'s global options**, so `git -C <path> stash pop`,
`git --git-dir=… tag -d v1` and `git --no-pager gc` sidestep every
rule anchored on `git stash` / `git tag -d` / `git gc`. The deleted hook
normalised for exactly this — and CLAUDE.md itself teaches `git -C
.claude/worktrees/<name>` as the cross-checkout idiom, so it is the spelling an
agent reaches for first. `Bash(git -*)` covers the whole class in one rule,
including options nobody has thought of yet. Do not replace it with an
enumeration.

**`scripts/quality-check.sh` asserts this by COMMAND STRING, not by rule name.**
Presence checks — "is rule X in the list" — passed for four review rounds while
real spellings slipped through, because they answer the wrong question. The gate
now carries ~56 real command strings in three lists, using the same prefix-glob
semantics the harness applies:

- `MUST_BE_DENIED` — checked against `deny` **only**, so a matching `ask` cannot
  certify a command that policy says is unapprovable.
- `MUST_BE_GUARDED` — checked against `deny` + `ask`; a prompt is acceptable.
- `MUST_NOT_BE_GUARDED` — commands that must stay unattended: read-only git,
  and every `git push` spelling now that enforcement is server-side. This is
  what catches a rule that is too *broad*, the failure the blanket
  `Bash(git -*)` introduced — and, for push, a rule reinstated out of caution
  after the ruleset made it redundant.

When a new bypass spelling turns up, add the string to the right list first —
then fix the rule until the gate goes green.

**A rule that fails to match does not fall through to the `auto` classifier.**
It falls through to whatever `allow` rule covers the command — here `Bash(git
*)` in user settings — and runs unattended. That is exactly what `git push`
does now, by design. Precedence is `deny > ask > allow` **by category**, not by
specificity, so a broad `allow` is only ever overridden by an `ask` that
actually matches. That is why a too-narrow `ask` is worse than no rule: it
reads as covered while changing nothing.

**`defaultMode` is `auto`, and it is what makes the list above short enough to
work.** The `allow` list cannot enumerate what an issue actually needs — a
single `implement-issue` run reaches for compose, npm, python3, mkdir, cp and
a dozen one-off shapes nobody predicted — so under the plain `default` mode
everything unlisted prompts and the run stalls dozens of times. `auto` sends
those to a classifier instead, which decides without involving you; `deny` and
`ask` still bind on top of it. This lives in the **tracked** settings on
purpose: `defaultMode` is not a Bash rule, so it travels into every worktree by
itself. Putting it in the gitignored `settings.local.json` is what made an
autonomous run in the main checkout start prompting the moment it entered a
worktree, and what the deleted symlink hook existed to paper over.

The two `Bash` permission hooks that used to shape this are gone:
`auto-allow-worktree-destructive.sh` (a cwd-conditional auto-allow) and
`link-worktree-local-settings.sh` (a SessionStart symlink undoing the asymmetry
the first one created). They existed to express what settings.json could not,
and cost six false positives in a single day, *every one introduced by the fix
to the previous one*, including blocking a live beta release. With nothing left
to auto-allow around, the plain rules say it directly. Do not reintroduce a hook
to route around a prompt — delete the `ask` entry instead, and remember `deny`
beats `ask` beats `allow`, so adding an `allow` never cancels an `ask`.

`check-worktree-path.sh` stays. It guards Edit/Write, not Bash, and it is the
one thing here that has never produced a false positive: it compares two `git
rev-parse` results as strings and refuses an edit aimed at a different checkout
than the session's cwd. That is the failure this repo actually hits — a stale
absolute path from an earlier turn writing into the main checkout while ~20
worktrees are live — and unlike the Bash guards it never has to parse a command.
Anything added here must be that shape: compare resolved paths, never guess at
what a command string will touch.

**Never `git stash` — it is denied, everywhere in this repo.** There is exactly
one `refs/stash` per repository, shared by the main checkout and every worktree,
and the stack has no owner: one agent's `git stash` pushes an entry that another
agent's `git stash pop` will take, with no way to tell it was not theirs. With
~20 worktrees active that silently destroys work, and once popped and discarded
git offers no recovery. `permissions.deny` lists every mutating form (bare `git
stash`, `push`, `save`, `pop`, `apply`, `drop`, `clear`, `branch`, `create`,
`store`), **each with a `git -* stash <verb>` twin**, so the global-option
spelling `git -C <dir> stash pop` is denied too — that is the form the
cross-checkout recipe below would otherwise reach for, and it was a live
bypass until #596.

`git stash list` and `git stash show` still work, in both spellings. The twins
name a verb for exactly that reason: a blanket `git -* stash *` deny also
caught `git -C sub stash list`, and `deny` has no override, so it hard-blocked
inspection rather than merely prompting for it. `scripts/quality-check.sh` pins
both directions — the mutating forms must match a **deny**, the read-only forms
must match **nothing**.

**The OS sandbox is what makes the unattended list safe, and it is on.**
`sandbox.enabled` confines every Bash write to the repository, decided by the OS
from the actual syscall rather than guessed from a command string. That is why
`rm -rf` needs no prompt: outside the repo it cannot create *or* unlink — the
macOS profile denies `file-write-create` and `file-write-unlink` in one rule.

**`allowWrite` must name the repo root, and that is the whole trick.** Writes
are `allowOnly` minus `denyWithinAllow`, and the built-in `allowOnly` is only
`/dev/*`, `/tmp/claude`, `~/.npm/_logs` and `~/.claude/debug` — **the repository
is not in it**. So `allowWrite: ["."]` is what opens the repo at all. An earlier
attempt set `allowWrite: [".claude", ".git", "scripts"]`, three paths that are
all on the deny list, never opened the repo root, and concluded from the
resulting breakage that the sandbox was unusable. It isn't; that config was.

**What stays denied cannot be re-opened.** There is no allow-within-deny
primitive for writes (reads have one, which is why `allowRead` differs), so no
`allowWrite` entry overrides the built-in `denyWrite` list. Confirmed by
`verify-sandbox.sh`:

- **Create worktrees with `EnterWorktree`, never `git worktree add` from Bash** —
  the harness is not sandboxed; the Bash form writes `.git/config` and
  `.git/worktrees`, both denied. *(measured)*
- **`git checkout -b <branch> origin/<branch>` fails**, because recording the
  upstream writes `.git/config` — and it fails *after* creating the branch, so
  the branch exists while the command reports an error and leaves you on the
  old one. Use `git checkout -b <branch> --no-track origin/<branch>`, or just
  re-run `git checkout <branch>`. *(measured)*
- **`git push -u` does not set the upstream either**, and for the same reason —
  `.git/config` is denied. This bullet used to recommend `-u` as the way around
  the previous one; it is not. What it does is **push the ref successfully and
  then report an error**:

  ```
  error: unable to write upstream branch configuration
  ```

  The branch IS on origin at that point. Verify with `git ls-remote origin
  <branch>` rather than re-pushing, and don't read the message as a failed
  push. Use a plain `git push origin <branch>`; nothing in this repo's flow
  needs the upstream recorded. *(measured)*
- **`.git/objects`, refs and the index are NOT denied**, so commit, branch,
  reset and reflog work normally. *(measured — this is the one that matters)*
- The agent-config files are denied individually — `.claude/settings.json`,
  `.claude/hooks`, `.claude/skills`, `.claude/workflows`, `.claude/routines`,
  `.claude/output-styles`, `.claude/launch.json`, `.mcp.json` — but **not the
  `.claude` directory as a whole**. Edit those files with the Edit/Write tools,
  which the sandbox does not govern at all. *(measured)*
- `scripts/**` is **writable** from Bash. *(measured)* An earlier claim here
  that it was denied, along with `.github/` and the lockfiles, came from
  misreading the binary's *GitHub Actions* default config (it listed
  `~/actions-runner` and `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`) as the local one.

**The sandbox captures its policy ONCE, at activation, and ignores every later
edit. You cannot iterate on `sandbox.*` in one session.** The trap is that it
*looks* like you can: editing `.claude/settings.json` mid-session does activate
the sandbox, so a session that turns it on immediately finds itself sandboxed
and concludes the config live-reloads. It does not. Every subsequent edit —
widening `allowWrite`, adding `allowMachLookup`, anything — is silently ignored
while probes keep returning confident results measured against the *first*
config. This was learned the expensive way: four knobs were "tested" that way
and none of the results meant anything. A probe write to a path added to
`allowWrite` minutes earlier still returned `Operation not permitted`, which is
what exposed it.

**So: one config change, then a genuinely fresh session, then
`verify-sandbox.sh`.** Never a second edit in the same session. If a result
contradicts the config you are looking at, the config is not what is running.

### Why each non-default knob is there

All four were verified together by a fresh-session `verify-sandbox.sh` run.
Each exists for one measured failure — don't drop one because it looks
redundant:

- **`enableWeakerNetworkIsolation`** — `gh` is a Go binary and returned
  *"tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: OSStatus -26276"*: it cannot reach
  `trustd` to verify TLS. Egress itself was never the problem — `curl
  https://github.com` returned 200 in the same sandbox. This is the documented
  knob for exactly this, and it is explicitly weaker: it opens `trustd`, which
  is a potential exfiltration path.
- **`network.allowMachLookup`** (`SecurityServer`, `securityd`, `trustd`) —
  `gh auth status` returned *"The token in keyring is invalid"*. gh reads its
  token from the macOS keychain, which is XPC, not network. The same block is
  why `git push` emitted `failed to store: 100001` — the credential helper
  could not cache the credential, though the push itself still landed.
- **`network.allowLocalBinding`** — `podman info` returned *"dial tcp
  127.0.0.1:64752: connect: operation not permitted"*. The podman VM is reached
  over a local TCP port, so `filesystem.allowRead` and
  `network.allowUnixSockets` are both the wrong knob.
- **`filesystem.allowWrite: [".", "~/GitHub/bess-manager"]`** —
  `frontend/node_modules` and `.venv` are symlinks into the main checkout, so
  writes through them land outside a worktree's own root and fail `EPERM`,
  breaking `vitest` and `vite build`. Native worktrees live under
  `.claude/worktrees/`, i.e. *inside* the main checkout, so that one entry
  covers them and every symlink target. That entry hardcodes this machine's
  layout, which is ugly in a tracked file; it is there because the alternative,
  a user-level `allowWrite`, is refused by the auto-mode classifier —
  correctly, since that is a session widening its own containment.

  **It does not cover a sibling checkout.** `../bess-manager-feature/` sits
  under `~/GitHub/`, not `~/GitHub/bess-manager`, so it is writable only via
  the `"."` entry resolving to that session's own cwd. A session working *on* a
  sibling from elsewhere — the main checkout, or another worktree — is silently
  blocked. Sibling folders are still first-class for running and inspecting
  code; they just need their own `allowWrite` entry if a session has to reach
  one from outside. `verify-sandbox.sh` skips its symlink check outside a
  linked worktree rather than reporting a PASS that proves nothing.

- **`filesystem.allowWrite`: the two user-level caches `worktree-setup.sh`
  writes** — `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` (plus its Linux spelling
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright`) and `~/.npm`. Setup runs `npm install` when a
  lockfile has diverged and then `npx playwright install chromium`; both write
  outside every repo path above, and the built-in allow list covers only
  `~/.npm/_logs`, not the package cache beside it.

  **Neither failure names the sandbox, which is the whole reason these are
  documented.** npm reports `EPERM` on `~/.npm/_cacache` as *"Your cache folder
  contains root-owned files … please run: sudo chown -R 502:20 ~/.npm"* — a
  guess, not a diagnosis: nothing is root-owned, and `sudo` is on the `ask`
  list and is the wrong fix. Playwright's step is bounded by
  `worktree-setup.sh`'s own timeout, whose message blames a slow download, so a
  blocked cache is indistinguishable from the genuine Playwright hang that
  timeout exists for (see below — a separate bug, and the two must not be
  conflated). One session lost a whole worktree setup to that before the cause
  was probed directly.

  Do **not** dodge the Playwright half by pointing `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`
  into the repo. Browsers are ~170MB and deliberately shared by every worktree;
  a per-worktree cache re-downloads them ~20 times over. `verify-sandbox.sh`
  probes both caches with `mkdir`, creating the directory first so a fresh
  machine reports a real result rather than skipping.

### The Playwright install hang is a version bug, not a slow download

Distinct from the sandbox problem above, and repeatedly misread as one. There
is **no issue tracking it** — `worktree-setup.sh` cites #556 only because that
is the work it was first seen during, and #556 (dependency caching) is closed.

Measured 2026-08-17, unsandboxed, on this machine:

| Playwright | Browser build | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1.59.1 (the pin in `e2e/package.json`) | `chromium-1217` | stalls at **exactly** 84 files / 448K, twice |
| 1.62.1 (current latest) | `chromium-1234` | completes, minutes later, same network |

**It is not the download.** In both stalled runs the full 173MB zip had already
landed in `$TMPDIR/playwright-download-*`, and `sample`ing the process showed
`oopDownloadBrowserMain.js` idle at 0% CPU with every libuv worker parked in
`__psynch_cvwait`. The failure is in *extraction*, after a complete fetch —
which is why waiting it out never works and why the timeout's "no progress"
wording sends readers to the network.

So `worktree-setup.sh` cannot install browsers on the pinned version, and the
likely fix is bumping `@playwright/test` past 1.59.1. Not done yet: it moves
the E2E runner under 14 CI wizard scenarios and needs its own PR. Until then a
worktree needing browsers is blocked, and the workaround is to drive an
already-installed Chrome rather than to keep retrying the install.

`sandbox.excludedCommands` is **not** used and is not needed. It was tried in
both project and user settings while the four knobs above were missing, appeared
to do nothing, and is now moot.

**What the verification does and does not cover.** It exercises `gh auth
status` (the keychain and TLS paths — good coverage of what `gh pr create`
needs) and `podman info` (the socket/TCP connection only, *not* that a compose
E2E completes). A full Step 8 run and a `gh pr create` are still the first real
proof. If either fails, re-read the error before touching config: every knob
here was found by reading the actual message, and every wrong guess came from
reasoning about what *ought* to be blocked.

**Verify with `bash scripts/verify-sandbox.sh` in a FRESH session after any
change to `sandbox.*`, and let the Bash TOOL run it.** Fresh because of the
capture-once behaviour above. Bash tool because the sandbox applies only to
commands Claude Code itself runs — a `!`-prefixed or terminal-typed invocation
is unsandboxed and would pass the permissive checks while failing the
restrictive ones, which reads exactly like a real result. Check 0 catches that.

To set work aside on the branch you are on, use a temporary WIP commit — it
lives on the branch, so it is per-worktree, private to that agent, and
recoverable by SHA even if the branch moves:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "wip: <what>"   # set aside
git reset --soft HEAD~1                     # pick back up
```

To move changes *across* checkouts (the case stash used to cover), pipe a patch
through the shared object database — verify it landed before reverting, since
`git checkout --` is the destructive step and there is no stash to fall back on:

```bash
git diff -- <file> | git -C .claude/worktrees/<name> apply
git -C .claude/worktrees/<name> diff -- <file>   # verify
git checkout -- <file>                           # only then
```

The full procedure, including the staged-changes variant, is in
`docs/agents/rules.md` under Working Location.

**The Bash rules apply identically in the main checkout and in every worktree.**
There is no cwd-conditional behaviour left, so nothing changes when a session
enters a worktree.

**Don't add a prompt where git already refuses.** `git branch -D` and plain
`git worktree remove` are deliberately not in the `ask` list: git itself blocks
the dangerous case (it won't delete a branch checked out in another worktree,
and won't remove a worktree holding uncommitted or untracked files). A second
prompt there buys nothing and costs a stall on every run — `implement-issue`
Step 4's prune loop alone would have hit ~24 of them.

**GitHub now refuses the dangerous pushes, which is the same reasoning one
layer out.** `--force`, `--force-with-lease` and `+refspec` all used to ask,
because a prefix glob could not tell them apart from a plain push. None of them
ask now: against a protected ref GitHub rejects the push outright, and against
an unprotected feature branch it was never the case that git could not undo it.
That removed a prompt from `implement-issue` Step 9 without removing a guard —
see "Pushing is guarded server-side" above for the ruleset table and the one
residual it accepts.

**A force push should still be treated as a finding when it appears.** Neither
`implement-issue` nor `release` mentions `rebase`, `--force` or
`--force-with-lease` anywhere, and this project merges the target branch before
a PR instead of rebasing — a merge-based flow never needs one. So if a
transcript shows a force push, an agent has gone off-script into a rebase or an
amend of already-pushed commits. That is now caught by reading what happened
rather than by a prompt, which is the trade: no stall on the common path, and
the destructive path is refused by the server instead of by you.

**What the unattended set actually risks is uncommitted work**, since the
sandbox contains writes to the repo but cannot distinguish a wanted write from
an unwanted one. Tracked content
survives anything on the list — `git reset --hard` and `rm` on a tracked file
are both recoverable from the object database, and a discarded commit is
recoverable by SHA from the reflog. Uncommitted, untracked work is not. That is
the argument for the WIP-commit habit below, and it is why `git stash` is denied
rather than merely prompted: it is the one command that destroys another agent's
uncommitted work rather than your own.

**Only tracked files travel into a worktree**, and the permission setup is now
entirely tracked: `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/hooks/*` follow every
worktree automatically, so a session behaves the same wherever it runs. Keep it
that way. `.claude/settings.local.json` is gitignored and exists only in the
main checkout; the previous design leaned on it and then needed a SessionStart
hook to symlink it into each worktree to undo the asymmetry. Anything that has
to hold in a worktree belongs in the tracked settings. The doesn't-travel
problem still applies to `.venv` and `frontend/node_modules` (see
`scripts/worktree-setup.sh`, issue #556).
