    optimizer's own `input_data` in his debug bundle
    (bess-debug-2026-07-25-090230.md), the full 60-period (15h) horizon of the
    latest run (2026-07-25 09:00-24:00 CEST): SOE starts at 1.65 kWh, below
    `min_soe_kwh=1.8`, with real solar surplus in the morning and a negative
    sell price for the first 36 periods, followed by a clearly profitable
    evening price window (buy up to 0.394, sell up to 0.161 EUR/kWh) that
    makes an early-charged battery valuable later in the horizon.

    Before the fix, `_idle_battery_flows` (and the vectorized IDLE branch in
    `_compute_reward_grid`) zeroed the real charging credit for any period
    starting below `min_soe_kwh`, while the wear-cost term still charged the
    real SOE delta -- making genuine solar-charging look artificially
    unprofitable. SOE stayed pinned at 1.65 kWh for periods 0-8 despite free
    solar and a negative sell price throughout, only starting to rise once
    the DP's own bookkeeping (elsewhere) inconsistently let it through --
    exactly what the reporter observed (SOLAR_EXPORT at 11% SOC, 0% charge
    rate, sell price negative). After the fix, charging starts immediately.
