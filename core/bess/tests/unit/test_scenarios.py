    """Replays the exact optimizer input recorded in #466's second debug
    bundle (bess-debug-2026-08-07-232503.md, run at optimization_period 93,
    horizon 99 starting 23:15). The sunrise-crossover periods 27-30
    (06:00-06:45) forecast solar 0.1461 kWh against home 0.1675 kWh -- an
    ~86 W residual, below the smallest discharge the percent lattice can
    command even at #512's finer grid (0.1 kW). Pre-fix those periods sat
    IDLE and imported the residual at ~0.64 SEK/kWh while the battery held
    4.34 kWh above reserve at a local shadow price of ~0.55 -- i.e. the
    DP's own economics said covering it was cheaper (buy * eta_discharge =
    0.607 > 0.549), but no executable action expressed it: sub-residual
    lattice candidates do not exist, and every overshooting one is removed
    by #497's executable-only rule.

    Post-fix the residual-cover candidate (discharge exactly the forecast
    net load, no export) is in the action space, so these periods plan
    LOAD_SUPPORT with zero grid flows. Executability is asserted per
    period rather than assumed: load-first delivers min(actual load,
    ceiling), which at forecast equals the planned residual exactly, so
    R == P holds to numerical noise -- the invariant #282/#497 exist to
    protect and the reason this candidate plans a delivery rather than a
    rate-step command."""
