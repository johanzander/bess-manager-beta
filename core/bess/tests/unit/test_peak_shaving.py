"""Peak-shaving grid-import cap (issue #96, Option B).

`peak_shaving_import_cap_per_period` generalizes the fuse-derived
`import_cap_kwh` mechanism (#429) from a horizon-wide scalar to a per-period
cap: outside a configured window it is None (no constraint), inside it it
caps grid import for that period. The same "constrain, don't raise"
mechanism (#429) that already blocks grid-charging and forces discharge to
cover load applies -- this just varies the cap by period.
