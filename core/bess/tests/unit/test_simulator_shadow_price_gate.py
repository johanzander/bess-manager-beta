"""Issue #388: the plan-faithfulness simulator's `_map_rates` is a hand-
maintained mirror of `InverterController._map_intent_to_rates` that has no
`shadow_price` parameter and never calls `intra_period_discharge_gate` --
so `run_scenario_realized`/`verify_plan_faithfulness` cannot exercise the
shadow-price intra-period discharge gate (SOLAR_EXPORT/SOLAR_STORAGE since
#187/#319) at all.

#385 briefly extended this gate to LOAD_SUPPORT too; #393 reverted that
extension (see test_load_support_discharge_gate.py) after real-world data
showed the gate opens for the large majority of LOAD_SUPPORT periods rather
than the narrow "reserve genuinely not needed elsewhere" case it was meant
for. LOAD_SUPPORT is back to its plan-scaled cap only, unconditionally.

These tests use a real DP-optimized schedule (`optimize_battery_schedule`),
not a hand-built period/decision, so the gate branch is genuinely reachable
by the same code path `run_scenario_realized` drives -- per
docs/agents/testing.md's plan-faithfulness requirement for control/rate-
mapping changes.
