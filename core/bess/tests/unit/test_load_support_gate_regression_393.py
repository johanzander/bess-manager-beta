"""#393 regression: LOAD_SUPPORT must never be pushed past its plan-scaled
discharge cap, replayed against a real user's captured data.

`core/bess/tests/unit/data/regression_2026_07_26_203726.json` is a real
optimizer input (buy/sell price, home consumption, solar production, battery
state) captured from a user's debug bundle via
`scripts/mock_ha/scenarios/from_debug_log.py --issue 393`. Running the actual
DP against it reproduces the finding that motivated reverting #384/#385's
LOAD_SUPPORT extension of `intra_period_discharge_gate`: the gate-open
condition (`buy_price * eff_d >= shadow_price`) evaluates true for the large
majority of this run's LOAD_SUPPORT periods (51 of 67) -- not the rare "reserve
genuinely not needed elsewhere" case the gate was designed for.

This test replays that same real data through the production control-mapping
path (`derive_control_command`, the simulator's mirror of
`BatterySystemManager._apply_period_schedule`) and asserts LOAD_SUPPORT stays
at its plan-scaled baseline throughout -- so if the gate is ever
re-extended to LOAD_SUPPORT without being validated against this exact
regime, this test catches it.
