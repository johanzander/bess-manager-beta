"""The period after a spliced PWL window must report flows derived from the
state the splice actually left it in.

A window owns periods `[start, end)` but writes the SOE at `end` -- its pinned
exit state. The period AT `end` is not re-solved, so it keeps the flow record
the selection loop derived from its PRE-splice start SOE. Once
`_replay_accounting_pass` stopped re-deriving flows (Phase 3 Task 2), that
record and the reported `battery_soe_start` could describe different states.

`resolve_pwl_window` only guarantees the exit lands within
`_end_soe_pin_tolerance`, not exactly. Every corpus fixture happens to land it
to ~1e-15, so no fixture exercises this -- the pin is perturbed deliberately
here rather than waiting for one to drift.

The boundary period must be IDLE-with-passive-charging for this to
discriminate at all: `_idle_battery_flows` derives `battery_charged` from the
SOE delta, so a stale record is visible. A discharging boundary computes
`battery_discharged` from the action alone, which no splice can move -- such a
period cannot detect the bug, and a test written against one would pass
whether or not the fix exists.
