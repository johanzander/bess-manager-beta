"""
Behavioral tests for Growatt TOU scheduling system.

These tests verify WHAT the system does (behavior) rather than HOW it does it (implementation).
They should remain stable even if the internal algorithm changes (fixed slots, tiny segments, etc.)
as long as the business requirements are met.

Key Principles:
- Test strategic intent execution (does BATTERY_EXPORT enable battery discharge?)
- Test hardware constraints (no overlaps, chronological order)
- Test operational efficiency (minimal writes)
- Test business logic (IDLE uses default mode)
- Do NOT test internal data structures, field names, or algorithm-specific details
