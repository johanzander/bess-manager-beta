"""The single ordered preference table that resolves near-tied DP actions
(principle P2, `docs/agents/optimizer-architecture.md`).

Every near-tie the optimizer has ever mis-resolved was fixed by bolting one
more bespoke tie-break function onto the selection path (#466, #510, then #512
widening #466's guard). Each was individually correct and each narrowed the
next one's room: the two functions ran in a fixed order, the second measured
its epsilon band against the *first's* output rather than against the argmax,
and whether they could fight was a property of their guard clauses rather
than of a stated ordering. P2 replaces that with one table, applied once,
all rows measured against the argmax winner:

1. **Eligibility (import guard).** A candidate that imports more grid energy
   than the argmax winner is never preferred.
2. **Eligibility (within epsilon).** Only candidates the DP genuinely cannot
   rank -- inside `epsilon_for_period`'s value noise -- are eligible. A
   decisive winner (every alternative more than epsilon behind) is therefore
   alone in the set and no row can move it.
3. **Prefer the largest load-tracking discharge** up to the period's net
   load (#466).
4. **Prefer the highest-SOE candidate** when this period's sell price was
   floored by the #269 curtailment rule (#510).
5. Otherwise the argmax winner stands.

Rows 3 and 4 keep their own, deliberately *different* winner guards -- see
their docstrings. A single shared "bail on any non-idle winner" guard cannot
express the asymmetry and would re-open the hole #512 closed.

Adding a new tie symptom's fix here means adding or reordering a row, with
its rationale and economic bound in the row's docstring. It does not mean a
new function on the selection path; `optimizer-architecture.md`'s compliance
check fails a PR that adds one.

    **Row 1 -- never import more grid energy than the argmax winner.**
    Lifted out of the retired curtailment tie-break, where it kept the
    charge-early swap free: a candidate that stores more by *buying* the
    energy (the full-rate charge candidate inside a below-floor window) is
    never preferred over one that only absorbs surplus. Promoting it to a
    table-wide guard is a deliberate strengthening. It does bind on the
    load-cover row -- when the winner is itself a partial-cover discharge,
    a *smaller* within-epsilon discharge imports more than the winner and
    is excluded here (115 of 2194 selector calls across the fixture corpus
    have such a candidate) -- but it never changes that row's outcome,
    since row 3 only ever moves to a discharge at least as large as the
    winner's, which by construction imports no more. Do not read this row
    as inert for a future row: it is a live bound.

    Recorded foreclosure: in a negative-buy-price window a within-epsilon
    grid top-up is arguably the safer pick against a solar shortfall, and
    this row permanently bans it. That codifies today's behavior; an
    amendment relaxing it must cite this note and bring field evidence.

    **Row 2 -- within epsilon of the argmax value.** Measured once, against
    `candidates[argmax_index].value`, never against a previous row's output.

    Precision about what this fixes: the retired chained pair could not
    actually spend `2 * epsilon` in any reachable state --
    `_prefer_load_covering_discharge` returned either the argmax or a
    discharge, and `_prefer_curtailed_charge_absorb` returned immediately on
    a discharge winner, so the two bands could never compound. Anchoring
    every row at the argmax makes epsilon-compounding **unrepresentable
    rather than merely unreachable**: it survives inserting a row, widening
    an existing one, or reordering the table, none of which the old
    arrangement would have survived. This is not a record of a past
    miscomputation.

    The band is inclusive (`<= epsilon`), which is what makes the table live
    at `epsilon == 0`. Both retired tie-breaks returned early on a
    flat value function (dV/dSoE == 0 -> epsilon 0 -> no scale for "tied"),
    disabling tie resolution in exactly the most degenerate tie there is.
    At epsilon 0 an inclusive band admits only bit-exact ties -- candidates
    the DP's own objective declares indistinguishable -- and preferring the
    fail-safe side of a bit-exact tie forfeits exactly zero model value.
    Cycle cost already sits inside `_compute_reward`, so the preference is
    not spending wear it failed to price. No epsilon floor is introduced:
    a nonzero gap, however small, still ranks the candidates and the argmax
    winner stands.

    discharge that covers no more than this period's forecast net load.

    Rationale (spec 2026-08-07-idle-tie-break-design.md): within epsilon --
    the value noise the DP's own SOE grid-snapping injects -- the DP cannot
    rank the options, but they are not symmetric in risk. A load-covering
    discharge fails safe: the inverter tracks *actual* load, absorbing a
    consumption forecast miss for free. IDLE fails unsafe: discharge is
    hard-disabled, so the entire miss is imported at the buy price. This is
    ridax67's principle in code -- IDLE must mean the optimizer WANTS to
    hold energy (a decisive margin), never that it merely EXPECTS balance
    (a coin flip). Deliberate arbitrage holds are untouched by construction:
    their margin over discharging exceeds epsilon, so nothing else is
    eligible.

    Eligibility is exact cover or under-cover only, with no round-up
    allowance (#497): every candidate overshooting the deficit by less than
    the export resolution was already excluded from the candidate set as
    unexecutable, and anything overshooting by more is a genuine export,
    never a load-cover swap target. Among eligible candidates the largest
    coverage wins -- fuller coverage means less residual import exposed to
    a miss.

    **Winner guard (row 2 of the plan's table, per-preference by design).**
    This row stands down on a *charge* winner and on a discharge already
    beyond the load cover; an IDLE winner or a *partial*-cover winner stays
    eligible so a partial cover can be improved to a fuller one. That last
    part is #512: which of several tied candidates `argmax` returns is an
    enumeration-order accident, and at the finer grid it started landing on
    partial covers, silently skipping the swap and leaving residual import
    exposed. Charge winners are never flipped to discharges -- a semantic
    change no phase has declared. Row 4's guard is deliberately different
    (it bails on discharge winners and may still improve a charge winner),
    which is why the two guards live on their rows instead of being merged.

    Economic bound: each swap forfeits at most `epsilon` (empirically
    ~0.003-0.015 SEK per period, and exactly 0 in the epsilon == 0 case row
    2 newly admits), but a single horizon can contain many swapped periods
    and the aggregate is bounded only empirically -- fixture evidence puts
    the worst observed full-horizon cost at +0.032 SEK, inside the #450
    budget of 0.05 SEK. Separately, for small net loads the eligibility band
    is wide in SEK/kWh terms, so swaps fire more often than #467's tie
    detector flags near-ties; deliberate, since every swapped candidate is
    within epsilon -- value noise, not a real gap -- of the argmax winner.

    charge-rate 0% + export-limit 0 (PV physically clipped to house load,
    above-forecast production wasted) and spends the plan's slack against a
    later solar shortfall before the next positive-price block. Charging
    earliest is stochastically dominant -- equal model reward, strictly
    better under forecast error in either direction.

    larger absorb. Note `incoming_index` rather than `argmax_index`: the
    guard reads the action chosen so far (row 3's output), while eligibility
    and the epsilon band stay anchored at the argmax. That is the whole of
