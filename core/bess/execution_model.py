"""The execution model: what a command means on the platform that executes it.

Phase 4a of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-optimizer-target-architecture.md`
(design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-phase4-executable-candidates-design.md`,
decisions D1 and D2).

This module is a **leaf**: it imports `settings` and `dp_constants` and
nothing else in `core.bess`. That constraint is the whole point of D1, not a
style preference. `simulation/inverter_simulator` needs the intra-period
discharge gate and so did `battery_system_manager`, which is why the gate used
to live in the orchestrator; the optimizer core (`action_selector`,
`dp_battery_algorithm`, `pwl_window_dp`) needs the same platform facts to know
which actions are executable. With the gate here, both sides depend on a leaf
instead of the optimizer depending on the thing that runs the optimizer.
`dp_battery_algorithm:_run_dynamic_programming` already works around one
import cycle with a function-local import; per `rules.md`'s workaround check,
adding a second was not an option.

What lives here is the platform half of the execution model -- the lattice a
discharge rate is quantized to, what a discharge *number* means once written,
the mode vocabulary, and the smallest gear that can be commanded. Turning a
planned action into a full command (mode + rate + reactive semantics) is 4b's
work and lands here too; 4a deliberately moves no candidate logic.

    All three intents map to load_first; SOLAR_EXPORT/SOLAR_STORAGE plan
    discharge_rate=0, LOAD_SUPPORT plans a nonzero plan-scaled rate. In every
    case the battery can additionally cover an actual (sub-period) solar/load
    deficit beyond whatever was planned. Whether it SHOULD is economic: cover
    from battery only when the stored energy is worth less than buying from
    grid now.

    That comparison is made by the DP (`_record_marginal_value`), which owns
    the value function the marginal value comes from, and arrives here as
    ``decision.intra_period_discharge_allowed``. This function does not
    re-derive it: doing so from a ``shadow_price`` scalar could not tell a
    computed zero from a never-computed one, and opened the ceiling on absent
    data (#526).

    Returns 100 (allow discharge) or 0 (hold the reserve, buy the dip from
    grid).

    """What the executing platform can express, as the optimizer needs to see
    it (D2: a separate object, not extra fields on `BatterySettings`).

    `BatterySettings` holds physical-battery facts sourced from user config;
    these are platform facts sourced from the active controller, with a
    different lifetime. `discharge_rate_is_load_following` already living on
    the controller rather than in settings is evidence the split is real.

    The defaults describe the TOU-register platform the DP has always
    implicitly assumed (integer-percent lattice, rate-as-ceiling), so a caller
    with no controller -- unit tests, the synthetic corpus, a manager without
    hardware -- gets exactly the pre-4a behaviour.

    Fields:
      `discharge_resolution_kw` -- smallest controllable discharge increment,
        or None for the platform default of 1% of `max_discharge_power_kw`.
        This is the value `InverterController.discharge_resolution_kw()`
        returns; None is kept distinct from a computed value so the DP's
        default and a platform's explicit declaration stay distinguishable.
      `discharge_rate_semantics` -- one of the three constants above. This is
        about the *rate register*: what a number written into it does.
      `load_support_delivers_exact_cover` -- a different question, with a
        different answer on one platform: is a planned LOAD_SUPPORT discharge
        delivered as `min(plan, actual load)`? That is what the off-lattice
        exact-cover candidate needs (`action_selector._residual_cover_p`).
        On solax-modbus Growatt in VPP mode the rate register is a forced
        power -- so `discharge_rate_is_load_following` is False -- but
        LOAD_SUPPORT never writes a rate there: #413 disables remote control
        for that intent and hands the period back to the inverter's own
        load-following self-use (`_intent_to_vpp`). A cover plan is delivered
        exactly, so this stays True. Native SolaX never received #413 (gap
        note in `solax_controller._vpp_display_state`), so its LOAD_SUPPORT
        really is a forced `-(rate% x max_discharge)` and it is False.
      `control_model` -- the controller's `CONTROL_MODEL`, carried so 4b can
        derive the command without reaching back to a controller class.
      `intent_to_mode` -- the mode vocabulary (read-only).

    Instances are not hashable: `intent_to_mode` is a mapping view, so the
    frozen dataclass's generated `__hash__` raises. Nothing keys on a
    capability object today; if something needs to, hash the scalars.
