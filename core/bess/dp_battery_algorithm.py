"""
Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Optimization.

This module implements a sophisticated dynamic programming approach to optimize battery
dispatch decisions over a 24-hour horizon, considering time-varying electricity prices,
solar production forecasts, and home consumption patterns.

UPDATED: Now captures strategic intent at decision time rather than analyzing flows afterward.

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
The optimization uses backward induction dynamic programming to find the globally optimal
battery charging and discharging schedule. At each hour, the algorithm evaluates all
possible battery actions (charge/discharge/hold) and selects the one that minimizes
total cost over the remaining time horizon.

KEY FEATURES:
- 24-hour optimization horizon with perfect foresight
- Cost basis tracking for stored energy (FIFO accounting)
- Multi-objective optimization: cost minimization + battery longevity
- Simultaneous energy flow optimization across multiple sources/destinations
- Strategic intent capture at decision time for transparency and hardware control

STRATEGIC INTENT CAPTURE:
The algorithm now captures the strategic reasoning behind each decision:
- GRID_CHARGING: Storing cheap grid energy for arbitrage
- SOLAR_STORAGE: Storing excess solar for later use
- LOAD_SUPPORT: Discharging to meet home load
- BATTERY_EXPORT: Discharging to grid for profit
- IDLE: No significant activity

ENERGY FLOW MODELING:
The algorithm models complex energy flows where multiple sources can serve multiple
destinations simultaneously:
- Solar → {Home, Battery, Grid Export}
- Battery → {Home, Grid Export}
- Grid → {Home, Battery Charging}

OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES:
1. Primary: Minimize total electricity costs over 24-hour period
2. Secondary: Minimize battery degradation through cycle cost modeling
3. Constraints: Physical battery limits, efficiency losses, minimum SOC

RETURN STRUCTURE:
The algorithm returns comprehensive results including:
- Optimal battery actions for each hour
- Strategic intent for each decision
- Detailed energy flow breakdowns showing where each kWh flows
- Economic analysis comparing different scenarios
- All data needed for hardware implementation and performance analysis

    - Grid costs applied to energy throughput (what you draw from grid)
    - Cost basis includes BOTH grid costs AND cycle costs for profitability analysis

    DISCHARGE ACCOUNTING:
    - No profitability veto: every physically valid discharge gets a finite
      reward. IDLE, competing in the same max() during backward induction,
      already makes the hold-vs-discharge call correctly via the
      forward-looking value function -- a separate floor on top of that is
      redundant at best (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-dp-bellman-guardrail-removal-design.md).
    - Self-throttling (#240): a discharge overshooting home_consumption by
      less than BATTERY_EXPORT_THRESHOLD_KWH is not credited as export
      revenue -- load-first hardware never actually delivers it to the grid.

    Returns:
        (reward, new_cost_basis, grid_imported). `grid_imported` is exposed
        so callers can enforce the import-cap feasibility constraint (#429)
        without recomputing these flows.

# This is a behavioural-DISTINCTNESS threshold, empirically calibrated --
# not a duplicate-removal tolerance, despite the duplicate candidates
# (IDLE vs the SOLAR_EXPORT-below-max bypass, which land on the identical
# next_soe) being what first exposed the problem. Removing literal
# duplicates needs only ~SOE_STEP_KWH (0.05 kWh); 1.0 kWh is 20x that, and
# per the calibration sweep it is the DOMINANT lever on the trigger rate,
# not a safety margin around a smaller principled value. Sweeping it over
# 0.05 -> 1.5 kWh moves suite-wide flagging from 15.6% of periods to 0.4%.
#
# It is set where it is because #450's own reproduction fixture has its
# genuine alternative 1.25-1.5 kWh away from the chosen action's next_soe
# -- charging in a different window -- while the mass of spurious
# near-ties across every other fixture sits below 1 kWh, i.e. nudging the
# same plan's power level. #450's case is still caught the whole way up to
# 1.25 kWh, so 1.0 kWh keeps margin on both sides.
#
# Two consequences worth knowing before touching this:
#
# 1. It suppresses the charge side almost entirely. _charge_candidate
#    returns a single POWER_STEP_KW (0.2 kW) gradient probe, which moves
#    SOE by only ~0.05 kWh at dt=0.25h (~0.19 kWh at dt=1h) -- always well
#    under this threshold. So the charge candidate can essentially never
#    be the runner-up, and "charge now vs charge later" (the case the
#    _tie_margin docstring names as the target) can only register as a tie
#    when the CHOSEN action is a large discharge and the alternative is
#    the far-away no-discharge state, never when the chosen action is
#    itself a charge.
# 2. TODO: it is an absolute kWh figure that scales with neither battery
#    capacity nor dt. Every fixture in the suite uses a similar-sized
#    battery, so no test can catch this. On a much smaller battery (say
#    5 kWh usable) a 1.0 kWh separation is a fifth of the whole range and
#    the detector would likely go silent -- and silently, since a missed
#    tie reproduces #450's bug rather than raising. Making it relative to
#    usable capacity needs a fixture with a small battery to calibrate
#    against.

    than that net load sits within `epsilon` of the best value, return that

    Rationale (spec 2026-08-07-idle-tie-break-design.md): within `epsilon`
    -- the value noise the DP's own SOE grid-snapping injects
    (tie_detection.epsilon_for_period) -- the DP cannot rank the two

    fails safe: the inverter tracks *actual* load, absorbing a consumption
    forecast miss for free. IDLE fails unsafe: discharge is hard-disabled,
    so the entire miss is imported at the buy price. Deliberate arbitrage
    holds are untouched by construction -- their margin over discharging
    exceeds `epsilon`.

    `rate_step` is the discharge percent-grid step (see

    Economic bound: each swap forfeits at most `epsilon` (empirically
    ~0.003-0.015 SEK per period), but a single horizon can contain many
    swapped periods, and the aggregate is bounded only empirically, not
    per-horizon -- fixture evidence puts the worst observed full-horizon
    cost at +0.032 SEK, inside the #450 budget of 0.05 SEK. Separately, for
    small net loads the eligibility band above is wide in SEK/kWh terms, so
    swaps fire more often than #467's tie detector flags near-ties; this is

    """One-step Bellman recompute at a true continuous SoE, using the
    already-known V[t+1, :] (linearly interpolated) as the continuation
    value -- the same reward+max(V) logic as _run_dynamic_programming's
    backward pass, applied at the true replay state instead of one snapped
    to the nearest grid index. Used by optimize_battery_schedule's Step 2 to
    reconstruct the continuous path without trusting a policy table computed
    for a slightly different state. See
    docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-dp-bellman-guardrail-removal-design.md.

    Candidate actions are the exact breakpoints of the piecewise-linear
    reward+continuation objective (see
    docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-dp-continuous-action-reformulation-design.md)
    rather than a fixed power grid -- `power_levels` is unused for the
    search itself, kept only for call-site compatibility with
    `_discretize_state_action_space`.

    Returns (best_action, best_next_soe, best_new_cost_basis, best_reward,
    tie_margin), where tie_margin is the gap between the chosen action's
    value and the best *behaviourally distinct* runner-up's value --
    float("inf") if no distinct alternative was feasible, meaning "not
    tied, no comparison possible". Used by the hybrid PWL tie detector
    (#450) to find near-tied periods without re-deriving this comparison.

    "Behaviourally distinct" means landing more than TIE_DEDUP_SOE_KWH away
    in next_soe (see _tie_margin): several candidates evaluated here are
    duplicates of each other in outcome -- most notably IDLE and the
    SOLAR_EXPORT-below-max candidate whenever there is no solar surplus to
    route differently, which land on the identical next_soe with the
    identical value. Ranking those against each other reports margin 0.0
    for a period with no ambiguity at all, which is not the situation #450
    is about (two genuinely different battery actions being close enough
    that the grid-snapped continuation-value lookup could flip the choice).
