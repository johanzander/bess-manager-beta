"""The single candidate enumeration + evaluation + selection implementation
(principle P1, `docs/agents/optimizer-architecture.md`).

Every pass that has to *choose* a battery action calls `select_action`,
parameterized by a continuation-value evaluator `eval_V(next_soe)` and its
local slope: the grid DP's forward replay evaluates V by interpolating a
grid row, the PWL window's forward replay evaluates the same objective
against a piecewise-linear row. Nothing else differs between them, which is
why they were two hand-mirrored 200-line functions until Phase 1 of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-optimizer-target-architecture.md` --
kept in sync by "mirror" comments and by whoever remembered to read them.
Adding a candidate type, guard, cap or preference to one of those and
missing the other is the #236 bug class; here it is unrepresentable.

The two *backward* passes -- `dp_battery_algorithm._run_dynamic_programming`
and `pwl_window_dp._pwl_candidate_values_at` -- keep their own numpy
evaluators for speed (P1 permits this explicitly: they estimate V over a
whole state grid at once and never emit an action). They consume this
module's candidate-space definitions -- `_residual_cover_p`,
`_discharge_is_unexecutable` -- and the platform lattice from
`execution_model.PlatformCapabilities` rather than restating them, so the
action space itself has one definition even where the evaluation loop does
not.

    """Is this discharge one no inverter can actually carry out as commanded?

    True when the commanded discharge overshoots the home deficit by less than
    `GRID_FLOW_RESOLUTION_KWH`. Such an action is unexecutable on every
    platform, for two different reasons that happen to coincide:

    - Load-following firmware simply throttles it back to the deficit
      (`inverter_simulator.mode_to_power`: `min(deficit, rate_kw * dt, ...)`),
      so the overshoot never leaves the property.
    - Hardware that would deliver it produces an export below the resolution
      of the energy counters that measure exports, so `EnergyData`'s noise
      fold (#350) attributes it back to the home regardless.

    Excluding these is the whole of the #497 fix. Proposing one anyway meant
    the DP priced an export that never happened and drew energy from the
    battery that never left it, emitting a period whose reported flows did not
    add up. Every earlier attempt patched a consequence instead -- #240 zeroed
    the export *credit* in the reward and left the *energy* overstated, which
    is precisely the band this predicate removes. Nothing downstream needs a
    threshold now, so none of them have to be kept in sync with each other.

    The lower boundary deliberately mirrors `EnergyData`'s fold condition
    (`battery_to_home > 0`, models.py): the band starts at any positive
    deficit at all, not at `POWER_TOLERANCE_KW` -- the fold has no such
    stand-down, so neither can this.

    The upper boundary is inclusive (`<=`) even though the fold's own bound
    is strict (`< GRID_FLOW_RESOLUTION_KWH`) -- deliberately, as float
    safety margin, not drift. At an overshoot of exactly the resolution the
    two sites compute the same physical quantity through different float
    paths (this predicate subtracts powers, the fold subtracts energies),
    and they can land on opposite sides of the boundary: measured on
    synthetic_seasonal_summer period 16, the DP saw overshoot 0.1 + 1e-16
    ("real export") while the fold saw battery_to_grid 0.1 - 2e-17 (folded
    to zero), yielding a period whose planned 0.16 SEK export revenue
    load-first execution never delivers. Excluding the exact boundary costs
    at most one marginal export candidate; admitting it re-opens the #497
    incoherence at float precision.

    Accepts a scalar or an array; returns the matching shape. Both the replay
    candidate set (`_discharge_candidates`) and the PWL window's feasibility
    mask (`pwl_window_dp._pwl_candidate_values_at`) route through here, so the
    two action-choosing passes cannot drift onto different action sets -- the
    failure mode `_backward_discharge_levels`' docstring warns about. The
    coarse-grid backward pass is the one deliberate exception: it only
    estimates V, never emits an action, and keeping in-band grid points there
    approximates the exact-cover breakpoint its lattice lacks -- see the
    comment at its feasibility mask in `_run_dynamic_programming`.

    When forecast home load exceeds solar by less than the smallest lattice
    candidate (`min_pct * rate_step`, see `_discharge_candidates`), the DP
    has no executable action that covers the residual: sub-residual lattice
    candidates don't exist, and every overshooting one is either excluded
    by `_discharge_is_unexecutable` (#497) or exports for real -- so IDLE
    wins by default and the home imports the residual at buy price even
    when the battery's marginal value says covering it is cheaper. On
    load-first hardware the exact-cover action is natively executable: the
    inverter delivers `min(actual load, rate ceiling)`, so a planned
    residual-cover discharge is delivered exactly at forecast
    (`inverter_simulator.py::mode_to_power`; VPP LOAD_SUPPORT is rate-less
    load-following, #413). Planning the *delivery* rather than a rate-step
    *command* is what keeps exact plan-faithfulness -- the property that
    ruled out keeping the smallest lattice step for this case in #497's
    design (see the carve-out note in `_discharge_candidates`).

    Two executability floors gate the candidate (both verified against the
    execution path, not assumed):

    - `residual * dt > 0.01 kWh`: `classify_strategic_intent`'s
      sub-threshold fallthrough labels a discharge LOAD_SUPPORT only above
      its `battery_discharged > 0.01` noise floor
      (`strategic_intent.py`) -- at or below it the period classifies IDLE
      and the command mapper would discharge nothing (R != P, the #282
      failure shape).
    - `residual <= round(residual / rate_step) * rate_step`: register/TOU
      platforms write an integer percent (`_scale_to_percent` rounds to
      nearest), and load-first delivery is `min(actual load, ceiling)` --
      so the plan is only exact when the rounded rate ceiling covers the
      residual. This subsumes the round-to-0% case (below half a step the
      ceiling is 0 and nothing executes) and rejects the round-DOWN bands
      `(k*rate_step, (k+0.5)*rate_step)` for k >= 1, where the commanded
      ceiling would under-deliver the plan by up to half a step (caught in
      review by executed repro: residual 0.12 kW -> 1% of 10 kW = 0.10 kW
      ceiling -> realized 0.10 for a planned 0.12).

    Residuals at or above the smallest lattice candidate return None: the
    percent grid already contains candidates at or below the residual
    there, and this helper must not widen #466's scope beyond the
    unrepresentable gap.

    **Only where a LOAD_SUPPORT discharge is actually delivered as
    `min(plan, actual load)`** (#580, Phase 4a). The paragraph above is the
    whole argument for this candidate: the plan is the *delivery*, and it is
    exact only if the hardware throttles to the real load. On native SolaX
    LOAD_SUPPORT is a forced `-(rate% x max_discharge)`, and on the
    period-list platforms (Growatt SPH, Solis, Huawei) there is no
    per-period control at all -- planning a partial cover there is planning
    a delivery that will not happen, the #282 shape. Before 4a the candidate
    was added unconditionally, which is what #580 records.

    Note this is `load_support_delivers_exact_cover`, **not**
    `discharge_rate_is_load_following`: on solax-modbus Growatt in VPP mode
    the rate register is a forced power, but LOAD_SUPPORT writes no rate --
    #413 releases the period to the inverter's own load-following self-use,
    so the cover is delivered exactly and the candidate belongs there.
    Gating on the register's semantics would have silently withdrawn #466's
    sunrise-crossover saving from that platform. Gated once, where the
    candidate is defined, rather than at each of the four call sites.

# 1.25 kWh, so 1.0 kWh keeps margin on both sides.
#
# Two consequences worth knowing before touching this:
#
# 1. It suppresses the charge side almost entirely. _charge_candidate
#    returns a single POWER_STEP_KW (0.1 kW) gradient probe, which moves
#    SOE by only ~0.025 kWh at dt=0.25h (~0.1 kWh at dt=1h) -- always well
#    under this threshold. So the charge candidate can essentially never
#    be the runner-up, and "charge now vs charge later" (the case the
#    _tie_margin docstring names as the target) can only register as a tie
#    when the CHOSEN action is a large discharge and the alternative is
#    the far-away no-discharge state, never when the chosen action is
#    itself a charge.
# 2. TODO: it is an absolute kWh figure that scales with neither battery
#    capacity nor dt. Every fixture in the suite uses a similar-sized
#    battery, so no test can catch this. On a much smaller battery (say
#    5 kWh usable) a 1.0 kWh separation is a fifth of the whole range and
#    the detector would likely go silent -- and silently, since a missed
#    tie reproduces #450's bug rather than raising. Making it relative to
