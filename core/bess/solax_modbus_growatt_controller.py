"""Growatt MIN/SPH inverter controller using solax_modbus (TOU or VPP mode).

This controller supports Growatt inverters connected via the solax_modbus
HACS integration (local Modbus) instead of the growatt_server cloud
integration, covering both GEN4 (MIN/MOD/MID) and GEN3 (MIX/SPA/SPH) hardware.

Two control strategies are supported, selected via ``control_mode``:

- ``"tou"`` (default, GEN4 only) — a **single TOU segment** (slot 1) with a
  full-day time window (00:00-23:59). The battery mode is updated per-period
  via ``apply_period`` — only when the mode actually changes — reducing the
  required entity count from 45 (9 slots x 5 entities) to just 5.
- ``"vpp"`` — Growatt's VPP remote power control registers (30100/30407-30410,
  present on both GEN3 and GEN4 per the solax_modbus Growatt plugin source),
  applying per-period power commands with no persistent schedule at all —
  the same "SM-Ephemeral" model ``SolaxController`` already uses for real
  SolaX hardware. See issue #118: GEN3 has no working TOU path today, so VPP
  is its only control mode; GEN4 gets a choice, with VPP intended to
  eventually replace TOU once proven on real hardware.

Mode semantics (TOU):
- ``load_first`` — inverter default when no TOU segment is active
- ``battery_first`` — charge from grid + solar (GRID_CHARGING intent)
- ``grid_first`` — export to grid (BATTERY_EXPORT intent)

VPP intent -> power mapping originally mirrored ``SolaxController``, plus a
block_passive_charging distinction at rate=0 (#355 -- see
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-vpp-passive-charge-block-design.md).
LOAD_SUPPORT has since diverged (#413 -- see below): ``SolaxController``
still forces a rate for it, this controller now releases VPP control instead.
- GRID_CHARGING              -> power=+100%, remote_control enabled
- BATTERY_EXPORT (rate>0)    -> power=-rate%, remote_control enabled
- LOAD_SUPPORT (any rate)    -> power=0, remote_control DISABLED, regardless
  of discharge_rate (#413 -- releases control to the inverter's own
  load-following self-use instead of forcing a fixed discharge rate, which
  causes unnecessary grid imports/exports whenever the schedule's load
  prediction misses)
- SOLAR_STORAGE (rate=0, block_passive_charging=False) -> remote_control
  disabled (load_first self-use -- battery may absorb solar surplus)
- IDLE (rate=0) -> power=+1%, remote_control ENABLED (battery-first hold,
  per the Growatt VPP protocol V2.01 section 3.5 -- #466: load_first
  self-use discharges the battery to cover house load, but the DP's own
  cost model never credits battery discharge during IDLE
  (_idle_battery_flows in dp_battery_algorithm.py); battery-first keeps
  self-consumption on grid/solar instead. grid_first (power<=0) does not
  achieve this -- per #118, self-consumption is still drawn from the
  battery in grid_first, only battery-first releases it to grid/solar)
- IDLE (rate=0) **at the reserve floor** -> power=0, remote_control
  DISABLED (#592 -- the hold above protects stored energy, and at the floor
  there is none left to protect; keeping remote control enabled rewrites the
  command every period to refresh the fallback timer, so the inverter is
  never handed back and its BMS never sleeps). Releasing rather than
  commanding power=0 with remote control enabled is what keeps this
  flow-neutral -- see _intent_to_vpp
- SOLAR_EXPORT (rate=0, block_passive_charging=True) -> power=0,
  remote_control ENABLED (grid_first hold, per the Growatt VPP protocol
  V2.01 section 3.5 -- battery held flat, solar bypasses to grid)

The VPP fallback timer (``vpp_time``, register 30408) is rewritten every
active period, resetting the inverter's own dead-man's-switch: if BESS stops
writing (crash, restart), the inverter reverts to load_first on its own once
the timer lapses — the same safety property ``SolaxController`` gets from
SolaX's autorepeat duration.

          IDLE's own DP cost model never credits battery discharge for load
          (_idle_battery_flows), so self-consumption must come from
          grid/solar, not the battery. grid_first (this function's block=True
          branch) does NOT achieve that -- per #118, self-consumption is
          still drawn from the battery under grid_first; only battery_first
          releases it to grid/solar. Checked before the generic rate=0
          branch below so IDLE doesn't fall into SOLAR_STORAGE's self-use
          disable. Not yet real-hardware-validated; ships experimental
          pending confirmation.
        - grid_charge=False, rate=0, intent=IDLE, at_reserve_floor=True
          -> 0%, remote control DISABLED (#592). The battery_first hold above
          protects stored energy from self-consumption; at the floor there is
          none left to protect, so it buys nothing and costs the inverter its
          sleep -- remote control being enabled makes _apply_period_vpp
          rewrite the command every period to refresh the fallback timer
          (#404), so the inverter is never handed back and the BMS never
          idles down.

          Releasing, rather than writing power=0 with remote control still
          enabled (which is grid_first), is what keeps this flow-neutral:
          load_first still absorbs passive solar surplus exactly as the
          battery_first hold does, where grid_first would bypass it to the
          grid -- a real change, since IDLE's DP cost model does credit that
          absorption. Flow-neutrality is proved in
          test_vpp_simulator_branches.py::TestIdleAtReserveFloor.

          **How far the battery can actually fall is the inverter's own
          discharge_stop_soc, not BESS's min_soc, and in VPP mode BESS does
          not write that register** -- initialize_hardware returns before
          sync_soc_limits for control_mode="vpp" (#309). So if the inverter's
          own floor sits below the configured min_soc, released self-use can
          draw the gap between them to cover house load. That is not new
          here: LOAD_SUPPORT (#413) and SOLAR_STORAGE already release control
          the same way at any SoC, so this extends an existing exposure to
          IDLE rather than creating one -- and it is bounded by the gap
          between the two floors, which is zero on a correctly configured
          inverter. `vpp_simulator` models the release as a hold at
          min_soe_kwh (available == 0), i.e. it assumes the two floors agree.
          Flagged for real-hardware confirmation with #592's reporter.
        - grid_charge=False, intent=LOAD_SUPPORT, load_tracking_active=True
          -> +1%, remote control ENABLED (#520). The boundary command for a
          tracked period: the hold, with remote control armed so the tick loop
          can rewrite `vpp_power` between boundaries without re-running the

          computed rate, because this function is a stateless mapper with no
