# ChargeIQ — Smart Battery Optimization for Home Assistant

**Install it, forget it, and slash your energy bills.** ChargeIQ continuously optimizes your battery against live electricity prices, solar forecasts, and your household patterns.

### Setup in Minutes, Not Hours

No YAML files. No manual entering of entity IDs. The setup wizard auto-discovers your inverter, price source, and solar forecast from Home Assistant — just confirm and go.

### See Exactly Where Your Money Goes

ChargeIQ tracks every kWh and every cent. Compare three scenarios side by side — what you'd pay with **grid only**, with **solar only**, and with **solar + optimized battery** — so you can see exactly how much value the battery adds.

### Predictions You Can Trust

See how accurate the forecasts are — solar, consumption, and savings — with predicted-vs-actual comparisons so you know it's working, not guessing.

### Ask Your Battery Why

Something look off? The built-in AI Analyst explains every decision in plain language. Ask "why did the battery charge at 3am?" or "why are today's savings lower than yesterday?" and get a real answer backed by actual system data.
