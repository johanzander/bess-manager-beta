# BESS Manager Software Design

## System Overview

The Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Manager is a Home Assistant add-on that optimizes battery storage systems for cost savings through price-based arbitrage and solar integration. The system uses dynamic programming optimization to generate optimal daily battery schedules at 15-minute (quarterly) resolution while adapting to real-time conditions.

## Architecture Principles

- **Event-Driven Design**: Hourly updates and schedule adaptations based on real measurements
- **Component Separation**: Clear boundaries between data collection, optimization, and control
- **Deterministic Operation**: Explicit failure modes, no fallbacks or defaults
- **Data Immutability**: Historical data is immutable, predictions are versioned

## Core Components

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Initialize and configure system components
- Create and update battery schedules using dynamic programming optimization
- Apply scheduled settings to Growatt inverter via Home Assistant
- Coordinate hourly updates and real-time adaptations
- Manage system settings and configuration

**Key Methods**:

```python
def update_battery_schedule(current_period: int, prepare_next_day: bool = False) -> None
def adjust_charging_power() -> None
def update_settings(settings: dict) -> None
def get_current_daily_view(current_period: int | None = None) -> DailyView
def start() -> None
```

### SensorCollector

**Purpose**: Collects energy data from Home Assistant sensors with validation and flow calculation.

- Collect quarterly (15-minute) energy measurements from InfluxDB and real-time sensors
- Calculate detailed energy flows (solar-to-home, grid-to-battery, etc.)
- Validate energy balance and detect sensor anomalies
- Reconstruct historical data during system startup

**Data Sources**:

- InfluxDB for historical cumulative sensor data
- Home Assistant API for real-time readings
- Sensor abstraction layer for device independence

### HomeAssistantAPIController

**Purpose**: Centralized interface to Home Assistant with sensor abstraction.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Manage sensor configuration and entity ID mapping
- Provide unified API for reading sensor values and controlling devices
- Handle different sensor types (power, energy, state)
- Support sensor validation and health checking
- Control Growatt inverter settings (battery modes, TOU schedules)

**Sensor Abstraction**:

- All sensor access uses method names, not entity IDs
- Configurable sensor mapping for different hardware setups
- Centralized validation and error handling

### Dynamic Programming Optimization Engine

**Purpose**: Core algorithm that generates optimal battery schedules.

**Algorithm Flow**:

1. **State Initialization**: Start with current battery SOC and energy basis
2. **Solar Integration**: Apply predicted solar charging (free energy)
3. **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Find profitable charge/discharge pairs
4. **Constraint Optimization**: Respect battery capacity, power limits, consumption needs
5. **Economic Modeling**: Include battery cycle costs, price calculations

**Inputs**:

- Variable-length electricity price forecast at 15-minute resolution (from current period through end of available data; may span into the next day when tomorrow's prices are available)
- Battery parameters (capacity, limits, cycle cost)
- Consumption predictions (one entry per period, matching price array length)
- Solar production forecast (one entry per period, matching price array length)
- Current battery state and cost basis

**Outputs**:

- Battery actions (charge/discharge/idle) for each period in the horizon
- Expected battery SOC progression at 15-minute resolution
- Economic analysis (costs, savings, decision reasoning)

### DailyViewBuilder

**Purpose**: Creates complete daily views combining actual and predicted data at quarterly resolution.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Merge historical actuals with current predictions
- Provide always-complete quarterly data for today (92–100 periods) for UI/API
- Recalculate total daily savings from combined data
- Mark data sources (actual vs predicted) for each period

**Data Integration**:

- Historical data from HistoricalDataStore (immutable)
- Predicted data from ScheduleStore (latest optimization)
- Real-time current state for seamless transitions

### HistoricalDataStore

**Purpose**: Immutable storage of actual energy events that occurred.

**Data Model**:

```python
class PeriodData:
    period: int  # Period index (0-95 for normal day)
    energy: EnergyData  # Actual measured flows
    timestamp: datetime
    data_source: str = "actual"
    economic: EconomicData
    decision: DecisionData
```

**Key Features**:

- Immutable once recorded
- Complete energy flow tracking
- Physics validation (energy balance)
- Supports data reconstruction after system restart

### ScheduleStore

**Purpose**: Versioned storage of optimization results throughout the day.

**Storage Model**:

```python
class StoredSchedule:
    timestamp: datetime
    optimization_period: int
    optimization_result: OptimizationResult
```

**Key Features**:

- Stores complete optimization results with metadata
- Tracks when and why each optimization was created
- Enables debugging and analysis of optimization decisions
- Supports multiple optimizations per day as conditions change

### InverterController Hierarchy

**Purpose**: Converts optimization results to inverter-specific commands.

**Base class** `InverterController` provides shared intent-to-control mapping, hourly settings aggregation, and the abstract schedule interface. Three subclasses implement hardware-specific logic:

- **GrowattMinController** — Growatt MIN/MID/MOD (AC-coupled). Groups quarterly periods into TOU intervals (max 9 segments). Only creates segments for battery-first/grid-first; idle periods use load-first default.
- **GrowattSphController** — Growatt SPH (DC-coupled). Uses separate charge/discharge period lists (max 3 each) with global power and SOC settings per write call.
- **SolaxController** — SolaX (Modbus VPP). Issues per-period active-power commands instead of storing a persistent TOU schedule. Idle/solar periods disable VPP; charge/discharge periods set a watt target with autorepeat.

**Hardware Integration**:

- Each subclass formats schedules for its inverter's API
- Handles inverter-specific constraints and capabilities
- Manages schedule deployment and updates

### PriceManager

**Purpose**: Manages electricity price data and calculations.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Fetch electricity spot prices for current day and next day (Nordpool or Octopus Energy)
- Calculate retail buy/sell prices with markup, VAT, additional costs
- Support multiple price areas (Nordpool SE1-SE4, Octopus Agile UK)
- Provide price forecasts for optimization

**Price Calculation**:

```python
buy_price = (spot_price + markup) * vat_multiplier + additional_costs
sell_price = spot_price * export_rate - tax_reduction
```

### PowerMonitor

**Purpose**: Real-time power monitoring and charging adjustment.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Monitor electrical phase loading to prevent circuit overload
- Calculate available charging power based on current consumption
- Dynamically adjust battery charging power to stay within fuse limits
- Provide safety margins for electrical system protection

## Data Flow Architecture

```

## Key Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming Optimization

The DP algorithm uses **backward induction** to find the globally optimal battery schedule. Starting from the last period and working backwards, it evaluates all possible battery actions (charge/discharge/idle) at each period and selects the action that minimizes total electricity cost over the remaining horizon.

**State space**: Discretized battery state of energy (SOE) levels.

**Actions**: Discretized charge/discharge power levels, filtered by physical constraints (available energy, remaining capacity, power limits, temperature derating).

**Transition**: Each action updates SOE accounting for charging/discharging efficiency losses, and updates the cost basis of stored energy (FIFO accounting).

**Objective**: Minimize net electricity cost (grid import cost minus export revenue) while accounting for battery cycle degradation costs and a terminal value for energy remaining at end of horizon.

**Output**: For each period, the algorithm produces the optimal battery action, the resulting detailed energy flows (solar-to-home, grid-to-battery, etc.), economic data (costs, savings), and the strategic intent classification.

**Profit threshold**: After optimization, total savings are compared against a horizon-scaled minimum threshold. If savings are too low relative to remaining day fraction, the schedule is rejected in favor of all-IDLE to prevent excessive cycling for marginal gains.

### Energy Flow Calculation

The system decomposes measured energy totals into detailed flows (e.g., solar-to-home, grid-to-battery) using energy conservation constraints:

```python

# Home load priority - consume solar directly first

solar_to_home = min(solar_production, home_consumption)

# Remaining solar allocated to battery then grid

solar_to_battery = min(remaining_solar, battery_charged)
solar_to_grid = remaining_solar - solar_to_battery

# Grid fills remaining consumption and battery charging

grid_to_home = max(0, home_consumption - solar_to_home)
grid_to_battery = max(0, battery_charged - solar_to_battery)
```

### Decision Intelligence

Each optimization provides detailed economic reasoning:

- **Immediate Value**: Direct economic impact of each hour's decisions
- **Future Value**: Expected benefits from strategic energy storage
- **Economic Chain**: Step-by-step profit/loss calculation explanation
- **Alternative Analysis**: Why other strategies were not chosen

### Battery Action Intent Detection

The system infers battery action intent solely from the energy flows computed by the DP algorithm. After each period is solved, the detailed flows in `EnergyData` are derived automatically and used to classify intent:

- **EXPORT_ARBITRAGE**: `battery_to_grid > 0.1 kWh`
- **LOAD_SUPPORT**: `battery_to_home > 0.1 kWh` and `battery_to_grid <= 0.1 kWh`
- **GRID_CHARGING**: `grid_to_battery >= 0.1 kWh`
- **SOLAR_STORAGE**: `solar_to_battery > 0.1 kWh` and `grid_to_battery < 0.1 kWh`
- **IDLE**: No significant battery activity in any flow

### TOU Schedule Generation

The InverterController converts action intents into hardware-specific schedules. Each intent maps to an inverter battery mode and control parameters (shown below for Growatt MIN; other inverters use the same intent mapping with different hardware commands):

| Intent | Battery Mode | Grid Charge | Charge Rate | Discharge Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GRID_CHARGING | battery_first | On | 100% | 0% |
| SOLAR_STORAGE | load_first | Off | 100% | 0% |
| LOAD_SUPPORT | load_first | Off | 0% | 100% |
| EXPORT_ARBITRAGE | grid_first | Off | 0% | 100% |
| IDLE | load_first | Off | 100% | 0% |

**Why SOLAR_STORAGE and IDLE share the same inverter settings**: Both use `load_first` because solar energy serving the home directly is always more valuable than routing it through the battery (which incurs cycle cost). If prices are cheap enough to justify prioritizing battery charging over home load, the DP algorithm uses `GRID_CHARGING` instead, which enables AC grid-to-battery charging via `battery_first` mode. Using `battery_first` without `grid_charge` would cause unnecessary grid imports by routing solar to the battery first while the grid serves the home.

**Schedule generation**:

1. Group consecutive 15-minute periods that share the same battery mode
2. Only create TOU segments for strategic modes (battery_first, grid_first) — load_first is the inverter default and needs no segment
3. Enforce hardware constraints: max 9 TOU segments, chronological order, no overlaps
4. Preserve past intervals to minimize unnecessary inverter writes

## Configuration and Settings

Settings are managed through the web UI and persisted to `/data/bess_settings.json`. The only setting that remains in the HA Supervisor-controlled `config.yaml` (and thus `/data/options.json`) is the InfluxDB connection.

### InfluxDB Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
influxdb:
  url: "http://homeassistant.local:8086/api/v2/query"
  bucket: "home_assistant/autogen"
  username: "your_db_username_here"
  password: "your_db_password_here"
```

### Runtime Settings (`/data/bess_settings.json`)

All other settings are stored in this file and managed via the settings API. Top-level sections:

- **`battery`**: `total_capacity`, `min_soc`, `max_soc`, `max_charge_power_kw`, `max_discharge_power_kw`, `cycle_cost_per_kwh`, `min_action_profit_threshold`, `charging_power_rate`, `efficiency_charge`, `efficiency_discharge`
- **`electricity_price`**: `area`, `markup_rate`, `vat_multiplier`, `additional_costs`, `tax_reduction`, `min_profit`, `use_actual_price`
- **`home`**: `max_fuse_current`, `voltage`, `safety_margin`, `phase_count`, `default_hourly`, `currency`, `consumption_strategy`, `power_monitoring_enabled`
- **`growatt`**: Inverter device ID and integration settings
- **`sensors`**: Entity ID mappings for all Home Assistant sensors
- **`energy_provider`**: Price source selection (Nordpool or Octopus Energy) and area configuration

### Auto-Configuration

On first startup with no sensors configured, the system offers an automated
discovery flow via the setup wizard UI.

**Discovery process**:

1. `GET /api/states` scans all HA entity states to identify inverter entities:
   - **Growatt**: matched by serial number prefix in entity IDs.
   - **SolaX**: matched by `solax_` prefix across all HA domains (`sensor`,
     `select`, `number`, `button`). The homeassistant-solax-modbus integration
     creates entities as `<domain>.solax_<suffix>` (single inverter) or
     `<domain>.solax_<serial>_<suffix>` (multiple inverters). Detection requires
     at least one known suffix from `SOLAX_ENTITY_SUFFIX_MAP` to confirm a genuine
     SolaX integration (not manually renamed entities). The prefix with the most
     matching suffixes is selected.
2. HA WebSocket API queries the config entry and device registries to resolve
   the Nordpool `config_entry_id` and Growatt `device_id`.
3. Optional integrations are detected by entity naming conventions (Solcast,
   Zaptec/Easee EV meters, phase current sensors, weather entity, discharge inhibit).
4. The user reviews and can correct the discovered mapping before applying.
5. Confirmed configuration is persisted to `/data/bess_discovered_config.json`
   and applied to the running system immediately without restart.

**Limitations**: Discovery relies on native integration entity naming.
Manually renamed entities will not be auto-detected — use the wizard to
correct sensor mappings manually.

## Health Monitoring

- **Sensor Validation**: Required vs optional sensors, data quality checks
- **Component Status**: Each manager reports operational status

### Key Design Principles

**Quarterly-First Architecture**:

- Internal data structures use one entry per period (92–100 depending on DST)
- The DP optimizer operates on a variable-length horizon (today's remaining periods plus tomorrow's when available)
- Simple integer indices (0-95 for a normal day, 0-91/0-99 for DST transitions)
- Array-based operations (slicing, summing, mapping)

**DST Handling**:

- Period count varies: 92 (spring), 96 (normal), 100 (fall)
- All components handle variable period counts
- No hardcoded 24-hour assumptions
- Validation uses ranges (92-100) not fixed values

**Data Flow**:

- **Price Provider**: Nordpool or Octopus Energy provides quarterly prices
- **Optimization**: Operates on variable-length arrays (today's remaining periods + tomorrow's when available)
- **Storage**: Indexes by period_index (0-95)
- **InfluxDB**: Queries at 15-minute boundaries
- **API**: Returns quarterly, aggregates only for display
- **Frontend**: Displays both resolutions as user preference


## Development and Testing

### Component Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation with synthetic data
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with real scenarios
- **Optimization Tests**: Algorithm correctness with various market conditions
- **Hardware Tests**: Inverter integration and sensor validation
- **Quarterly Tests**: DST transitions and period boundary handling

### Test Data

- **Historical Scenarios**: Real price data from high-volatility days
- **Synthetic Patterns**: EV charging, seasonal variations, extreme conditions
- **Edge Cases**: Sensor failures, price anomalies, hardware issues, DST transitions

### Quality Assurance

- **Code Quality**: Ruff, Black, Pylance compliance
- **Type Safety**: Strict typing with union operators (`|`)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and design documentation

### Mock HA Environment

The mock HA environment lets any user-reported issue be reproduced and debugged
locally, without access to the user's Home Assistant installation.

**Invariant**: `mock(debug_export)` must be indistinguishable from the real HA
installation at the moment the debug export was taken.

#### Workflow

```
/api/export-debug-data      ← debug export (markdown file)
from_debug_log.py           ← generates scenario JSON
mock-run.sh                 ← starts Docker Compose
  ├── mock-ha               (FastAPI, serves scenario data as HA REST API)
  └── bess-dev              (BESS backend, TZ + FAKETIME pinned to export time)
```

#### What the Debug Export Provides

| Field | Used for |
|---|---|
| `entity_snapshot` | Verbatim `/api/states/{entity_id}` responses for every sensor BESS reads |
| `historical_periods` | Actual measured energy flows — seeded directly into the historical store, no InfluxDB needed |
| `price_data` | Raw quarterly prices for `nordpool_official` service call responses |
| `addon_options` | Complete sensor entity IDs, inverter device ID, price provider config |
| `inverter_tou_segments` | Current inverter memory state for `read_time_segments` responses |
| `export_timestamp` + `timezone` | Pins `mock_time` so BESS computes the same optimization period |

#### Historical Seeding

At startup, `BatterySystemManager` checks for `BESS_HISTORICAL_SEED_FILE`. If
set, it loads `historical_periods` directly into the historical store and skips
InfluxDB backfill entirely. The sensor collector cache is then warmed from live
mock-HA values so runtime collections work correctly. The mock is fully
self-contained — no external database access required.

This design reflects the current quarterly-native implementation as of the latest refactoring, focusing on simplicity and correctness across all time-based operations.
